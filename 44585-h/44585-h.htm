To speed loading, drawings in-line with the text are at most
512 pixels wide, often less. Drawings that have dimensions
or other details that are important to properly executing a
project (as well as some drawings that are simply charming
to look at) are preserved as higher-resolution images linked
to the embedded images. When an in-line image has a thin black

<h2>
Plane-Table Surveying<br />
By Harold G. McGee

<div class='blkquot'>
<p>
        [In the training of a boy for a trade or profession there is
    none so profitable for outdoor work as that of a surveyor. This
    article sets forth how to accomplish surveying and the making of
    simple maps with the use of commonplace tools that any boy can
    make.&mdash;Editor.]
</p>
</div>

<p>
Surveying and map making have
always been two of the most interesting
things a civil engineer has had to
do. And, like George Washington,
many of the men we look up to today
as successes in different lines worked
as surveyors in their younger days.
Surveying takes one out of doors, and
is apt to lead him into the unknown
and unexplored byways of the earth.
</p>

<p>
Though modern surveyors often use
precise and expensive instruments,
creditable surveys can be made with
simple and inexpensive apparatus. Of
such apparatus, two of the simplest
are the plane table and the camera.
Since one must know the principles
of plane-table surveying before he can
do camera surveying, this paper will
describe the plane table alone, leaving
the camera for another chapter.
</p>

<p>
A plane table is simply a drawing
board mounted on a tripod so that it
can be set up and worked upon in the
field. One kind of plane table, which
is used in the army for reconnaissance,
does not even have a tripod; it is simply
strapped to the arm of the man
who is using it.
</p>

<p>
Plane-table maps vary greatly in
scale and the area they represent.
Landscape artists' plans may show
only single city lots, while some topographic
maps cover hundreds of
square miles on a single sheet. For
maps of a small farm, a park, or a
residence block in the city, a plane
table is almost ideal, since plane-table
maps are made with rather simple apparatus
and do not require much
actual measuring on the ground.
Most objects are located without ever
going to them, or even sending a rod-man
to them.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>[2]</a></span>
Besides the plane table itself and a
sheet of paper, only a small carpenter's
level, a tape to measure a few distances
with, and some spikes for
markers, a hard lead pencil, a ruler,
and a few needles are absolutely
necessary for this sort of a map.

  <p>Three
Stations
are Used for
Setting the
Plane Table
in Succession
to Locate
the Various
Objects
</p>

<p>
TABLE AT STA. A -
TABLE AT STA. B -
TABLE AT STA. C
</p>
</div>

<p>
To start a plane-table map, a station
must first be selected from which
as many as
possible of
the objects
to be located
on the finished
map
can be seen.
Ordinarily,
the objects
one would
locate are corners of
buildings, fence corners,
intersections of roads,
corners of lots,
banks of streams,
possibly trees,
and section
and quarter-section
corners in
the country. A
railroad, a lake, a
mountain, or
anything which
forms a noticeable
landmark in any particular locality,
ought to be on
the map. In
mapping a territory
which
has never been
surveyed before,
the first
surveyor may
name the hills
and streams.
</p>

<p>
After the first station has been selected,
it is marked by a pile of stones,
a stake, or, if precise work is to be
done, a tack in the top of a stake. The
table is then set up over this station
point and leveled so that the surface
of the paper will be truly horizontal.
Generally, too, the board is "oriented,"
that is, placed so that two of its edges
point north and south and two east
and west. It is then clamped so that it
will not move while working on it.
</p>

<p>
To begin the map, a point on the
table is chosen to represent the station
on the ground over which the table is
set. This point is marked by sticking
a fine needle into the paper, vertically.
A small triangle should be drawn
around the needle hole in the paper and
labeled "Sta. A," so that it will
not be lost in the maze of points
which will soon cover the sheet.
By sighting past this needle toward
some object which is
wanted on the map, like the corner
of a house, its direction can
be marked by setting another
needle on the far side of the table, in
line with the first and the given object.
Then, if a ruler or straightedge
be placed against these two
needles and a fine line drawn
connecting them, this line
will show the exact direction
of the object from
Sta. A. All the
other objects
which are
wanted on
the finished
map and can
be seen from
Sta. A are located by direction in the
same way.
</p>

<p>
The first points to have their direction
thus marked ought to be the next
stations to be occupied. If all the objects
to be located can be seen from
three stations, or even two of three
stations, three stations will be sufficient.
The distance to one of them
from Sta. A should be carefully measured
and laid off to scale along its
direction line on the map. Its place
on the map should be marked exactly
as the first station was, substituting
B for A. It is wise, after every few
sights at other objects, to take a sight
along the line AB to make sure that
the board has not turned. A good map
is impossible if the board twists.
</p>

<p>
To measure the distance between
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>[3]</a></span>
stations, a 50 or 100-ft. tape, or some
accurate substitute, is necessary. An
ordinary piece of iron telegraph wire,
105&nbsp;ft. long, is a good substitute. A
point, about 2-1/2&nbsp;ft. from one end, is
marked with a little lump of solder.
A chisel dent in this solder will mark
one end of the 100-ft. section. Then,
with a borrowed tape or a good rule,
measure off and mark every 10&nbsp;ft., just
as the first point was marked, until the
entire 100&nbsp;ft. have been laid off. The
last 10&nbsp;ft. should be divided into feet.
In all this measuring and marking, the
wire must be stretched out taut and
straight. The extra 2-1/2&nbsp;ft. at each end
are used for making handles. By estimating
the tenths of a foot, measurements
can be made with such a tape,
or "chain," as an old-time surveyor
might call it, just as accurately as they
can be laid off on the map.
</p>

  <img src='images/img003b.png' alt='img003b' title='img003b' />
</div>

<p>
Two men are required for measuring,
or "chaining," a head and a rear
chainman. The rear chainman holds
the 100-ft. end of the tape on the station
point, while the head chainman
takes his end forward toward the station
to which they are measuring.
When he has gone nearly the length
of the tape, the rear chainman calls
"halt." The head chainman stops and
draws the tape up tight, while the rear
chainman holds his division end on the
starting point. Then the head chainman
sticks a spike into the ground to
mark the place where his division end
comes, calls out "stuck," and starts on
toward the object point.
</p>

<p>
Large spikes make good marking
pins, especially if they have little red
or white strips of cloth tied to them.
Surveyors use 11 markers. One is
stuck into the ground at the starting
point and is carried forward by the
rear chainman, who also picks up the
markers at each 100-ft. point as soon
as the head chainman calls "stuck." In
this way, the number of markers which
the rear chainman has in his hand is
always the same as the number of
hundreds of feet which the last set
marker is from the starting point.
</p>

<p>
In measuring between two points,
care must be taken to draw the tape
out taut and straight, its two ends
must be level with each other, and it
must be exactly in line with the two
points between which the measurement
is being made. In measuring downhill,
one end may have to be held up
high, and the point on the ground
where the end division would come,
found by dropping a stone from the
place where it is in the air and watching
for the spot where the rock strikes
the ground. A surer way to do this is
to hold a plumb-bob string on the last
division and carefully let the bob down
until it touches the ground. A rod
with a red or white flag on it ought to
be placed at or just beyond the point
to which the measurement is to be
made so that the rear chainman can
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>[4]</a></span>
easily line in the head chainman. The
latter, before he places his marker,
looks back to the rear chainman to be
told whether or not he is "on line"
with the object point. If he is not, and
ought to go to the rear chainman's
right to get "on," the latter holds out
his right arm and the head chainman
moves accordingly. When he reaches
the right point, the rear chainman
signals "all right" by holding out both
of his arms and then dropping them to
his side; the marker is stuck, and both
move up a hundred feet and repeat the
process.
</p>

<p>
After all the points possible have
been located from Sta. A, and the direction
lines labeled lightly in pencil so
that they can be distinguished when
the board has been removed from the
station, the plane table is picked up
and carried to Sta. B. Here it is again
set up, leveled, and oriented by making
the direction of the line AB on the
paper exactly the same as that of the
line from Sta. A to Sta. B on the
ground. This is done by placing needles
at points A and B on the table and then
turning the board until the two needles
and Sta. A are in line. Sights are
taken on the same objects which were
"shot" at Sta. A, and to objects which
were not visible from Sta. A. The intersection
of the lines of sight toward
a given object from A and from B
marks the location on the paper of
that object. If the two ends of a
straight fence have been located in this
way, a straight line joining the points
will show the location of the fence on
the map. By exactly similar methods,
every other object is located on the
paper.
</p>

<p>
In order to avoid errors, it is an excellent
scheme to locate three stations
near the outside edges of the area to
be mapped, and locate all objects possible
by sights from each of the three
stations. If, instead of all three crossing
each other at a point, the lines of
sight from the three stations form a
triangle, something is wrong. If the
triangle is very small, it may be safe
to use its center as the correct point;
if not, the work must be repeated and
checked. Locating even a few points
by this method may prevent some bad
blunders. The three stations ought to
form as nearly as possible, an equilateral
triangle; and the distances between
all of them should be measured
and laid out accurately on the plane
table.

There are two ways in which the
map may be finished, inked, or traced.
By drawing in the "culture," that is,
the things built by man, like the
houses, the fences, the roads, and the
railroads, in black ink; the topography,
that is, the hills and valleys, in brown;
the water, in blue, and then erasing
all the construction lines, a very neat
map can be made. Another way is to
get some "onion-skin" paper, or some
tracing cloth, tack it over the penciled
map, and trace the lines right through,
using black India ink. This tracing
can be blueprinted, just as a photographic
film. A plain, neat title, describing
location of map; who made it
and when; the scale used; why it was
made, if it was made for a special
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>[5]</a></span>
purpose, and the direction of the north
point, ought to be on every map. The
topographic sheets published by the
United States Geological Survey are
good samples to follow. They have
been published for a great many places
all over the country, and single copies
can be obtained by sending 10 cents to
the Director, United States Geological
Survey, Washington, D. C.

Plane tables are almost as easily
made as they are bought. If there is no
old drawing board around the house,
a new bread board from the ten-cent
store will serve. For ordinary work,
a table which is 15 or 20&nbsp;in. square will
do very well. The board must be
mounted on a tripod so that it will be
rigid while it is being worked upon
and yet can be unclamped and oriented.
A brass plate, with a hole in it and a
nut soldered over the hole, screwed
to the bottom of the board will permit
the board and tripod to be bolted
together in good shape. Another
method, which is not nearly as good, is
to drill a hole clear through the board,
countersink it on top for a bolt head,
and bolt the board and tripod head
directly together. With the brass plate
and nut, the camera tripod can be
pressed into service if a nut of the
proper size has been used. The camera
tripod is, however, apt to be wabbly
with a drawing board on top; a much
more satisfactory tripod can be built
as shown in the accompanying drawings.
Each leg is made of two strips
of wood, 3/4 by 3/8&nbsp;in. and 3&nbsp;ft. long.
These strips are screwed together at
their lower ends, gripping a spike between
them which will prevent the legs
from slipping on the ground. The tops
of the strips are spread apart and
screwed to the opposite ends of an oak
or maple cleat. This cleat is, in turn,
screwed to the under side of the circular
tripod head.
</p>

<p>
In place of the two needles and the
ruler described for marking the line of
sight, most plane-table men use an
alidade, which is a combination of
two sights and a straightedge. A very
simple alidade may be made by mounting
two needles on a ruler. The
straight edge of the ruler is placed
against the needle which marks the
station at which the plane table is set
up. Then, by swinging the ruler
around this needle until its two sighting
needles come in line with some
object, the line of sight can be drawn
directly on the paper along the edge
of the ruler. A surveyor in India once
made an alidade out of a piece of
straightedge and two sights made of
native coins hammered out by a native
blacksmith. Two pieces of cigar box,
one with a fine vertical saw slit in
it, and the other with a vertical slot
and a piece of fine wire or silk thread
stretched down the center, glued to a
well planed, straight, flat piece of
wood, make a fine alidade. A careful
worker may be able to put his sights
on hinges so that they will fold down
when not in use.
</p>

<p>
More than anything else, map making
rewards care and accuracy, and
shows up slipshod workmanship. If
the pencils are sharp, the lines fine, and
if the work is checked often, beautiful
maps can be made with very simple apparatus.

Machine for Sketching Pictures
</h2>


<p>
An ordinary drawing board, with
the attachments shown, provides an
easy way to sketch pictures, even if
one is not proficient in this line of
work. It is only necessary to look
through the sight and move the pencil
about so that the knot in the thread
follows the outline of the landscape or
object being drawn.

  <p>This Machine Aids a Person in Drawing the True
Outline of a Picture</p>
</div>

<p>
The size of the machine depends on
the one building it, but a fair-sized
drawing board is sufficient for the beginner.
A strip of wood is fastened
to the board, near one edge, which has
a metal piece on each end, fastened to
the under side and bent up over the
end to form an extension for the rod
to support the moving parts. The
strip of wood should be 3/4&nbsp;in. wide
and 1/4&nbsp;in. thick, and the sliding arm,
holding the pencil, 1/2&nbsp;in. wide and 1/4&nbsp;in. thick. A like strip, but much
shorter than the one fastened to the
board, is also fitted with metal pieces
in an inverted position so the projections
will be downward. A 3/16-in. rod
is run through holes in the metal
pieces of the strips at both ends, and
soldered to those on the strip fastened
to the board. This will make a
hinged joint, as well as one that will
allow the upper strip to slide horizontally.
</p>

<p>
Centrally located on the upper
strip are two more strips, fastened
with screws at right angles to the
former, with a space between them of
1/2&nbsp;in. for the sliding center piece holding
the pencil. These pieces are further
braced with a wire at the back,
and crosspieces are screwed both on
top and under side, to make a rigid
guide for the sliding pencil holder. An
upright is fastened to the side of one
of these pieces over the center of the
upper horizontal sliding piece for a
screw eye to hold the thread. Another
screw eye is turned into the
crosspiece just under the one on the
support, so that the thread will run
perpendicularly between them. Two
more screw eyes are fastened, one into
the upper surface of the rear crosspiece,
and the other in the end of the
pencil holder, near the pencil. By
connecting these screw eyes, as shown,
with a thread, having a rubber band
fastened in the rear end and a knot
tied in it near the screw eye in the
upper end of the vertical stick, a means
for following the outlines of the picture
is provided.
</p>

<p>
A vertical stick is fastened to the
front edge of the board by means of
a notch and wedge. In the upper end
of this stick a very small hole is bored
for a sight, similar to a peep sight on
a rifle.
</p>

<p>
To use the machine, set the board
on a table, or tripod, and level it up
in front of the object to be drawn.
Look through the sight at the front of
the board and move the pencil about
to keep the knot of the thread on the
outlines of the picture to be drawn.&mdash;Contributed

  <p>THE BOY SURVEYOR</p>

<h2>
Camera Surveying<br />
By Harold G. McGee
</h2>



<div class='blkquot'>
<p>
[This article explains the preparation of the camera
for taking the pictures at each of the three stations,
after which the plates are developed, printed and kept
until a convenient time may be had for plotting the
ground. The succeeding article will give in detail the
making of the map from the photographs.&mdash;Editor.]
</p>
</div>

<p>
Camera surveying is simply plane-table
surveying in which the landscape
has been photographically picked
up and carried indoors. It has the enormous
advantage that one can obtain a
record of the utmost fidelity in a small
fraction of the time taken to do the
field work of even a sketchy plane-table
survey, and that plotting can be
done in the comfort and with the conveniences
of a drafting room. When
the hours one can work are short or the
periods of clear, dry weather are few
and far between, a camera is an ideal
surveying instrument. It sees and records
with the click of the shutter.
</p>

<p>
Surveying by camera was proposed
early in the infant days of photography;
but not until the eighties were
photographic surveys commenced in
earnest. With the extensive surveys
of the Canadian Rockies by the Canadian
government within the past
decade and the topographic surveys of
the Alps, the camera has very recently
indeed achieved the dignity of being
known as a "sure-enough" surveying
instrument. Even today, few surveyors
have ever used photography for
making surveys, even though for
mountain topography or any survey
which includes a large number of distinctive,
inaccessible landmarks, the
camera asks no odds of either the plane
table or the stadia transit.
</p>

<p>
A camera survey taken of the summer
cottage or the camping ground
will be a source of great delight while
it is being plotted up of winter evenings.
There is something weird in
watching each tent and dock slip into
its place with naught but a pair of dividers
and a few pictures to do the trick.
And when the map is done, there are
all the data to tell just where a tennis
court can go or a walk ought to be built.
</p>

<p>
In making surveys, a plate camera
will do more accurate work than will
a film camera; and a fixed focus is a big
help in plotting. In spite of the special
and expensive instruments which
have been designed solely for surveying
work, a little ingenuity on the part
of the owner of most any kind of a
camera, be it big or little, film or plate,
box or folding, will do wonders toward
producing good results.

  <p>A T-Shaped Level with Adjusting Nuts is Located

</div>


<p>
To be used for surveying, a camera
must be fitted with a spirit level and
some arrangement for cross hairs. A
T-shaped level on the bed or the box,
carefully adjusted, will show when the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>[9]</a></span>
plate is vertical and when the perpendicular
line from the center of the plate
to the center of the lens is horizontal.
Actual cross hairs in the camera are
not as good as four tiny points of V's,
one projecting from the middle of each
side, top, and bottom of the camera box,
just in front of the plate holder. How
the level is to be adjusted so that a
line between the upper and lower
points will be truly vertical, and one
through the die-side points truly horizontal
and on a level with the center of
the lens when the bubbles are in the
center of the spirit level, will be described later.

</div>


<h3>
Camera Preparation
</h3>

<p>
To prepare a camera for surveying,
it is necessary to arrange that the axial
center line through the lens to the plate
shall be level, and that the location of
the horizontal and vertical center lines
shall be indicated on the plate. A spirit
level is the best solution of the first
problem, and indicated center points of
the second.
</p>

<p>
The spirit level preferably may be
of the T-form, with two level tubes,
or of the "universal" circular form,
with which some hand cameras are
equipped. However, ordinary hand-camera
levels are generally too rough
and difficult of adjustment to insure accurate
work. On a view camera, the
level may be conveniently located on
the bed which carries the lens board.
If it is screwed to the under side of the
arms it will be convenient for use and
out of the way. The bed is likewise a
good location for the level on a folding
hand camera, while the top of the box
is about the only possible location with
a box-type instrument.
</p>

<p>
The cross hairs or center-line indicators
should be placed on the back of
the camera, just in front of the plate.
If indicators are used, fine-thread cross
hairs or pencil lines drawn on the
ground glass must be used temporarily
for making adjustments. Generally,
the two cross hairs will divide the
plate vertically and horizontally into
four equal parts and the hairs or indicators
will join the center point of the
sides and top and bottom of the opening
immediately in front of the plate.
But it is essential that the cross hairs
have their intersection in a line perpendicular
to the plate and passing
through the center of the lens. Thus
in a camera in which the lens is not
placed in the center of the plate, or in
which the rising and sliding front has
placed the lens off center, either or
both of the cross hairs may be off center
with regard to the plate.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img009'>
  <img src='images/img009.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Ordinary Round Level may be Used, but It Is
Not so Good as the T-Level</p>
</div>


<p>
After the cross-hair indicators and
the level have been attached to the
camera, adjustments are necessary.
Surveyors distinguish between permanent
and temporary adjustments, permanent
adjustments being those for
which the instrument maker is responsible,
and temporary adjustments being
those which can be and are made
in the field. The principal permanent
or maker's adjustments of the surveying
camera are those which insure the
center line through the lens, or axial
center line, or line of collimation, being
perpendicular to the plate, the intersection
of the cross hairs being on this
line, and that the cross hairs themselves
are mutually perpendicular.
Temporary or field adjustments must
be so made that one tube of the spirit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>[10]</a></span>
level shall be parallel with the axial center
line through the lens and the other
parallel with the horizontal cross hair.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img010a'>
  <img src='images/img010a.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Cross Hairs or Center-Line Indicators should
be Placed on the Back of the Camera</p>
</div>


<p>
The first field adjustment is made in
the following manner. The camera is
set up, complete with thread or pencil-line
cross hairs and level, and focused
on a stake whose top shall just come to
the horizontal cross hair at the center
of the plate, when the level tube parallel
with the center line of the lens reads
level. This stake may be driven to the
required elevation or a rod may be held
on it and the point where, in the image
on the ground glass, it is intersected by
the cross hair marked with pencil on
the rod as it is held vertically on the
stake. The distance to this stake is
measured from the camera and another
similar stake set at the same elevation
by the same method, but in an opposite
direction and at the same distance
from the camera. The two
stakes or the mark on the vertical rod
which is held on these stakes in turn
will be level with each other, though
they may not be level with the camera.
The camera is then moved to a
point very much closer to one stake
than to the other and again leveled. The
vertical distance from one stake-top
or mark on the rod is measured and the
camera then focused on the second
stake. If the level is actually in adjustment,
the distance from the second
stake top or mark will be exactly the
same as it was on the first. If not, the
difference, or "error," is found between
the two vertical distances from the
cross hair to the two stake tops. Half
this error is corrected by raising or
lowering one end of the level tube by
means of the threaded nuts which are
placed on it for the purpose. The
whole process is then repeated until
the vertical distances from the horizontal
cross hair at the center to the two
level stakes, one close to and one distant
from the camera, are identical.
The axial center line of the lens, or
the line of collimation, is then in adjustment
with the level. All that remains
is to make the horizontal cross
hair parallel with the cross level.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img010b'>
  <img src='images/img010b.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Maker's Adjustments Should Insure the Line of
Collimation being Perpendicular to the Plate</p>
</div>


<p>
This is done by using one marked
stake. The camera is leveled as far as
the "fore-and-aft" level is concerned
and the horizontal cross-hair point
at the center marked on the stake.
The camera is then swung round
until the stake just shows on
one edge of the ground glass, the fore-and-aft
or longitudinal level being
checked to make sure its bubble
is still in the center. Then the
bubble in the cross or transverse level
tube is brought to the center by means
of the threaded adjusting nuts, and
the camera is thrown hard over so that
the stake appears along the opposite
edge of the plate. This time, the bubble
of the longitudinal level being kept
in the center, half the error introduced
by turning from one edge to the other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>[11]</a></span>
is corrected. All of the adjustments
are then rechecked, and if they are
found correct the instrument is ready
for use. If a circular level be used, the
method of adjustment is exactly the
same, the swing of the bubble along the
axis of the camera and transverse to it
being used to determine the longitudinal
and transverse adjustments. Slips
of paper may be used for lifting one
side in place of the adjustment nuts of
the T-level.
</p>

<p>
A leveling head or ball-and-socket
joint on the top of the tripod will be
found of material aid in leveling the
instrument.
</p>

<p>
No great mechanical genius is necessary
to prepare a camera for or to make
a successful camera survey. But if a
boy have not patience and an infinite
desire for accuracy, camera surveying,
or indeed any sort of surveying, will be
a source of neither pleasure, satisfaction,
nor profit.

<h2>
To Make Transparent Paper
</h2>


<p>
Transparent paper of parchmentlike
appearance and strength, which can be
dyed with almost all kinds of aniline
dyes and assumes much more brilliant
hues than ordinary colored glass, can
be made in the following manner: Procure
a white paper, made of cotton or
linen rags, and put it to soak in a saturated
solution of camphor in alcohol.
When dry, the paper so treated can be
cut up into any forms suitable for
parts of lamp shades, etc.

Toasting Bread over an Open Fire
</h2>


<p>
Having experienced some difficulty
in obtaining good toast over a gas or
open fire I tried the following plan
with good results: An old tin pan was
placed over the flame and the ordinary
wire bread toaster clasping the slice of
bread was held about 1/2&nbsp;in. from the
pan. In a few minutes the toast was
crisp and ready to serve.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Adjustable Stilts
</h2>


<p>
The beginner with stilts always
selects short sticks so that he will not
be very far from the ground, but as he
becomes more experienced, the longer
the sticks the better. Then, too, the
small boy and the large boy require
different lengths of sticks. The device
shown makes a pair of sticks universal
for use of beginners or a boy of any
age or height.

  <p>Stilts Having Stirrups That can be Set at Any
Desired Height</p>
</div>


<p>
To make the stilts, procure two long
 sticks of even length, and
smooth up the edges; then begin at a
point 1&nbsp;ft. from one end and bore 12
holes, 3/8&nbsp;in. in diameter and 2&nbsp;in. apart
from center to center. If there is no
diestock at hand, have a blacksmith,
or mechanic, make a thread on both
ends of a 3/8-in. rod, 12&nbsp;in. long. Bend
the rod in the shape shown, so that
the two threaded ends will be just 2&nbsp;in.
apart from center to center. The
thread on the straight horizontal end
should be so long that a nut can be
placed on both sides of the stick. A
piece of a garden hose or small rubber
hose, slipped on the rod, will keep the
shoe sole from slipping. The steps
can be set in any two adjacent holes
to give the desired height.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Grape Arbor Built of Poles

<p>
In building outdoor structures, such
as grape arbors, pergolas, or arches, it
is not necessary to use sawed
lumber, as they can be built
as substantial, and frequently
more artistic
and cheap,
of poles.
These are easily obtained, especially in
the country or in the smaller cities
where there usually are many trees and gardens.

  <p>Arbor Made of Poles Which are Supported

</div>


<p>
The illustrated grape arbor consists
of but one row of uprights. Across the
top of each is placed a horizontal support
for the roof poles, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;1, which is carried near its outer
end by an inclined brace. The brace
should be connected at each end with
a toe joint, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2. The
upper end of the upright is beveled off
on both sides, to form a double-splayed
joint with the crosspiece. In order to
securely bind the roof of the arbor,
the long poles, or roof beams, should
be notched near each end to fit over the
supports. Similar notches in the poles
forming the side of the arbor are to fit
the uprights, thereby binding them together
and preventing toppling over.
Each set of long poles connecting two
uprights should have the end notches
the same distance apart, one pole being
used as a gauge. All the joints and
notches may be cut with a sharp hatchet.

<h2>
Plotting a Camera Survey<br />

<p>
A previously measured base
triangle with "stations" at each
corner is necessary for making a camera
survey, just as it is for the plane-table
survey. It is preferable to have
each of the three sides measured independently,
though if one side has been
accurately chained, the other two may
be less satisfactorily determined by the
use of the plane table. If the camera
has a fixed focus, it is possible to make
an entire survey from the two ends of
a single base line; but this method has
no check and should be used only when
and where the triangle method is impossible.
With an adjustable focus, it
will rarely give good results.

  <p>Two Fine Hair Lines must be Scratched on Each
Plate Before It is Used to Plot From, or to Make Pictures from Which the
Plotting is Done</p>
</div>

<p>
Once the triangle has been laid out,
the fieldwork is very simple. The camera
is set up at one station, carefully
leveled, and then a series of pictures is
taken, each single plate overlapping the
last so as to form a panorama of the
area to be mapped. The focus of the
lens must not be changed during a
series, and plotting is facilitated by
keeping the focus constant during all
the exposures which make up a survey.
To secure good depth of focus, a small
stop is generally used, since it is necessary
to use a tripod to keep the camera
level. If contours are to be drawn, the
height of the lens above the ground at
the station should be measured and
recorded. After a series has been taken
at each station, the fieldwork is complete.
It is an excellent plan to keep a
record of the plate numbers, and the
order in which and the station from
which the exposures were made, so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>[15]</a></span>
that the 10 or 12 plates which a small
survey will comprise may not get hopelessly
mixed up. If the camera is
turned each time to the right, clockwise,
and the plates are numbered A-1,
A-2, B-4, etc., indicating by A-1, for
example, the leftmost plate taken at
Sta. A; by A-2, the plate just to the
right of A-1, just as II is to the right
of I on the clock dial, and by B-4, the
fourth to the right taken at Sta. B,
there ought to be no difficulty in
identifying the plates after the
exact details of the ground are
forgotten.

  <p>Plot of the Ground as It Should
Appear After Locating the Objects
as They are Shown on the Pictures
from Each Point of the Triangle</p>
</div>

<p>
While the pictures are being
taken, "flags" of white
wood or with white-cloth
streamers tied to them
must be stuck in the
ground or held at the
other stations in order
that their exact
location can be
readily and certainly
found on
the plates. A few distinctive stakes,
some with one and some with two or
three strips of cloth tied to them,
placed at important points on the
ground will help immensely in the location
of knolls and shore lines.
</p>

<p>
In plotting a camera survey, either
the original plates, the prints, or enlargements
may be used. The plates
are the most accurate if a corrected
lens has been used; and the enlargements
made back through the lens will
be best if the images on the plates are
distorted. In any case, two fine hair
lines must be scratched on each plate
before it is used to plot from, or to
make the prints from which the plotting
is to be done. One of these lines
should connect the points at the top
and bottom of the plate, and the other,
the points at the sides. The vertical
line divides the objects which were on
the right of the center of the camera
from those that were on the left, and
the horizontal line connecting the
points on the sides separates the objects
that were above the camera
from those that were below.
</p>

<p>
If the survey has been made
with a lens that does not cover
the plate fully or that has considerable
uncorrected aberration,
causing distorted
shapes near the
edges and corners
of the picture, results
can be materially
improved by
plotting from enlargements.
In
making the enlargements,
the back of
the camera
should be
removed
and the light should be allowed to pass
through the plate and the lens in the
reverse order and direction of that
in which it passed when the negative
was made. In this way, the errors
which were made by the lens originally
will be straightened out, and the resulting
enlargements will be free from
distortion. To make successful enlargements
for surveying work, the
easel on which the bromide paper is
tacked must be square with the camera,
and the paper itself should be flat
and smooth. It is just as necessary to
keep the easel at a constant distance
from the camera during the enlarging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>[16]</a></span>
as it was to keep the same focus while
the original negatives were being made.

  <p>In Plotting a
Camera Survey the
Base Triangle is
First Carefully
Laid Out on the
Paper to Such
a Scale That
the Map will
be of Desirable
Size</p>
</div>

<p>
In plotting a camera survey the base
triangle is first carefully laid out on the
paper to such a scale that the map will
be of a desirable size. With the apex
of the triangle representing Sta. A, say,
as a center, a circle is drawn with a
radius as nearly equal as possible to
the distance between the optical center
of the lens and the plate when the picture
was taken. Ordinarily this will
be the focal length of the lens; but if
the camera was not focused most
sharply on an object a great distance
off, the radius may be greater. This
radius is called the "mapping constant."
When an approximate distance
for the mapping constant has been determined
by measurements on the camera
or by knowing the focal length of
the lens, the circle, or rather the arc,
FG between the two lines to stations
B and C, is drawn. The plates taken
at Sta. A, and ranged around this circle
on the outside and just touching it,
will show the landscape exactly as
seen from A.
</p>

<p>
In the accompanying diagram showing
the method of determining the
mapping constant and of locating the
traces of the plates, the letters F, G,
H, J, P, R and S designate points referring
to the true mapping constant,
and the construction necessary to locate
the traces of the plates. The
primed letters F', F'', G', G'', etc., are
used to show similar points where the
trial mapping constant is either too
long or too short. The following description
refers equally to the construction
necessary with true or trial-mapping constants.
</p>

<p>
Next, a line FH is drawn perpendicular
to the line AB of the triangle at
the point F where the arc intersects it.
On this line is laid off, in the proper
direction, a distance equal to the distance
on the plate or print from Sta. B
to the center vertical line. From this
point is drawn a light line, HJ, toward
the center of the arc. Where this line
crosses the arc, at J, a tangent, KJM,
is drawn, which will show the location
of the plate A-1 on the drawing. This
line is called the trace of the plate. An
object which appears both on plate A-1
and A-2 is next picked out and its location
on the trace of plate A-1 determined
by measuring the distance JN
equal to the distance on the plate from
the image of the object to the center
vertical line. A light line, NO, joining
this last-found point with Sta. A, is
then drawn. Where this last line
crosses the arc, at O, a tangent, OP, to
the arc is drawn, and the trace of the
plate A-2 is found with the aid of the
point which appears on both plates just
as plate A-1 was located from the picture
of Sta. B. The traces of plates
A-3 and A-4 are found in exactly the
same way as was that of A-2. If the
radius of the arc has been estimated
correctly, Sta. C will be found to be
exactly on the point where the trace of
the plate showing the station crosses
the line AC on the paper. If it does
not fall on the line AC, which is generally
the case, everything must be
erased except the original triangle.
First, however, a radial line S'G', or
S''G'', is drawn from the location of
Sta. C on the trace of the plate A-2,
3 or 4, as the case may be, to the arc,
and the point of intersection of this
line and the arc, G' or G'', is preserved.
If this point, G' or G'', is outside the
base triangle, the next trial arc should
be drawn with a larger mapping constant
as a radius, or vice versa. If the
second mapping constant is off, find
again the point of intersection of the
radial line through the new location of
Sta. C on the newly located trace of
the last plate and the new arc. Join
this point and the one found previously,
in the same manner, with a
straight line, G'G''. The point G
where this last drawn line intersects
the line AC of the base triangle, will
be the point through which the arc,
with the correct mapping constant as
radius, ought to pass, provided the first
two approximations were not too far in
error. This third trial ought to make
the location of the traces of the plates
exactly correct. If, however, the focus
of the camera was changed between
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>[17]</a></span>
exposures at one station, the traces of the
plates will not all be at an equal distance
from the station point, and their
location will be an almost impossible
task. The traces of the plates taken at
stations B and C are found in exactly
the same manner as were those for Sta.
A. After the traces have all
been located, it is a good plan
to ink them in lightly and
erase the pencil construction
lines which would otherwise
form an impenetrable
maze. The traces located,
the difficult and
tiresome part of the
plotting is over; the
landscape, brought
indoors photographically, is
located as with the plane table; all that
remains to be done is to take the sights
and find the points on the paper which
show where the objects were on the ground.

  <p>From Each Station the Mapping Constant
is Laid Out by
the Focal Distance
of the Camera or
Distance of the
Plate from the
Lens, and the
Location of
Traces of
the Plates
Determined</p>
</div>

<p>
This taking the sights is a simple
matter. With a pair of dividers, the
distance from a given object from the
center line of the plate is measured.
This distance is laid off on the proper
side of the point marking the center
line of the trace of the same plate; a
radial line is drawn through the trace
at the given distance from the center-line
point and the station at which the
given plate is taken; this is one line of
sight to the object. The same object
is located from another station in the
same way; as on the plane table, the
intersection of the two lines to the
same object marks the location of the
point which represents the object
on the map.
</p>

<p>
Obtaining elevations for the
drawing of contours is a slightly
longer process. Contours
are lines joining points of
equal elevation; they
represent successive
shore lines, if
the area
mapped were
inundated and
the water
should
rise slowly foot by foot. If the contours
are close together, the ground
represented has a steep slope, and vice
versa. If, on a map, a number of points
are of known elevation, it is simply a
question of judgment and practice to
tell where contour lines go.
</p>

<p>
Before contours can be drawn the
elevations of a considerable number of
points must be known. If the elevation
of any one of them is known and
the difference between that one and
any other can be found, determining
the elevation of the second point is
simply a problem in addition or subtraction.
If it be desired to find, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>[18]</a></span>
instance, the difference in elevation between
Sta. C and the corner of the
fence, as shown in the sketch, two solutions
are possible, as follows:
</p>

<p>
First: Perpendicular to the line of
sight from Sta. C to the fence corner,
two lines are drawn, one at the intersection
of the trace of the plate by the
line of sight, and one at the point on
the paper which shows the location of
the fence corner. On the first of these
two lines is laid off the distance Y',
equal to the distance of the ground at
the fence post above or below the horizontal
center line on the plate. Through
this point, on the first perpendicular on
the line of sight, is drawn a line
through the Sta. C and extended to an
intersection with the second drawn perpendicular.
The distance from the
corner of the fence, on the paper, to
this intersection is the distance Y, the
difference in elevation from the center
of the camera at Sta. C to the ground
at the fence post. This solution is
longer and less desirable than the
second.
</p>

<p>
Second: In place of perpendicular
lines to the line of sight, the trace of
the plate, and a line, through the point
representing the object, parallel with
the trace, may be used.
</p>

<p>
A datum plane, or reference surface,
from which all elevations are measured
up to the ground surface must be assumed.
The United States Geological
Survey uses mean, or average, sea level
for the datum in all its topographic
sheets. Generally, unless there is a
United States Geological Survey
"bench mark," a monument of carefully
determined elevation referred to
sea level, within the limits of the survey,
it is better to assume the elevation
of some point, as Sta. C, at 100&nbsp;ft., or
greater if necessary to place the datum
plane below the ground level at all
points within the area to be mapped.
Other elevations are figured from the
assumed elevation of Sta. C. Allowance
must be made for the height of the
center of the camera above the ground
at Sta. C in computing elevations
above Sta. C. All elevations determined
for the purpose of drawing contours
are ground elevations and not
the elevation of the top of objects located
on the map. The topographic
sheets of the Geological Survey are
good examples to follow, in drawing
contours. For many purposes, contours
are not essential, and the refinements
necessary for their drawing may
be omitted.

them with screws. Nail a crosspiece
on the plank edges in the exact center,
so as to space the planks 34&nbsp;in. apart,
as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2; then turn it over
and nail another crosspiece in the center
of the planks for width, and make
the spacing of the other edges 40&nbsp;in.
Plane the lower edges so that, in placing
a board across them, the surfaces
will be level. The floor boards are 6&nbsp;in. wide and fastened on crosswise, being

How to Make a Surveyor's Transit<br />

  <p>Detail of Parts for the Construction of a Transit
Which can be Used, with Fairly Accurate Results,
in Doing Amateur Surveying for Railroad Work,
Town Sites and the Laying Out of Maps</p>
</div>

<p>
A boy who likes to do the things
that "grown ups" do can derive considerable
pleasure from the making of
a transit, which will enable him to
start in surveying railroads, laying off
town sites, and doing lots of kindred
work. It is necessary to have a compass,
and one, 1-3/4&nbsp;in. in diameter, can
be purchased at a reasonable price. A
hole is bored with an expansive bit
into a board, 7/8&nbsp;in. in thickness, just
deep enough to admit the compass
snugly, then a circle, A, 4-1/2&nbsp;in. in
diameter, is drawn, having the same
center as the compass hole, and the
disk is cut out with a compass or scroll
saw. A ring, B, is cut in the same
manner from the same material, its
inside diameter being such that the
ring just fits around the disk A, and
the outside diameter, 6-3/4&nbsp;in. Another
block, 5-1/2&nbsp;in. in diameter, is glued to
the bottom of the small disk A. This
will appear as shown at C. A small
hole is bored in the center of the bottom
block on the under side to receive
the threaded end of the screw
on a camera tripod. By careful adjustment
the threads in the wood will
hold the transit firmly. A plumb bob
must be attached exactly in the center
of the tripod head. This can be
easily done if the head is wood, but in
case the top is of metal, the line can
be attached to the screw with a double
loop, as shown at D, so that the
bob will hang centrally. Two standards
are made as shown at E, each
about 5&nbsp;in. high, and fastened to the
ring B in the positions shown in the
drawing of the complete instrument.
An arc of a circle is marked on one of
the standards, as shown, to designate
angles, the markings being laid out
with a bevel protractor. The pointer is
a hand from an old alarm clock.
</p>

<p>
The telescope arrangement consists
of a piece of pasteboard tubing, about
1-1/4&nbsp;in. in diameter, one end being covered
with a piece of black paper with
a pinhole in the exact center, and the
other equipped with "cross hairs."
Four small notches are cut in the latter
end of the tube, exactly quartering
it, and two silk threads as fine as can
be obtained, are stretched across in
these notches. The tube is fastened
to a block of wood, 5&nbsp;in. wide and 7&nbsp;in. long, with small tacks and two
pieces of fine copper wire. This block
is pinioned between the standards with
two nails. The hand is secured to the
nail in such a position that it will point
straight down when the tube is level.
</p>

<p>
The instrument is adjusted in the
following manner: It is set up where
a lone tree can be seen, about one mile
distant, and the center of the cross
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>[21]</a></span>
hairs is carefully set on the tree. Then
a very fine wire is stretched across the
compass, as shown at F, and while
keeping it directly over the center of
the compass it is also placed on a direct
line pointing to the tree. Very
small brass nails, driven in at G and
H, serve to fasten it in the position
thus found. When this adjustment
has been made the telescope can be
turned to sight any object, after first
placing the instrument so that the
needle points to the N on the dial, and
a glance at the wire will show the exact
direction in which the object is located.
</p>

<p>
The instrument is then taken to a
level stretch of road and set up, and a
stick is placed on end and marked at
the height of the telescope. The stick
is taken along the road about 200&nbsp;yd.,
the telescope sighted on it, and the
hand set. This makes the instrument
level enough for all practical purposes.
The plumb bob is then dropped, a distance
of 20&nbsp;ft. measured from it on the
road, and a mark made. The telescope
is sighted on this mark, and a
mark is made on the standard at the
point of the arc, to which the hand
points. Another 20&nbsp;ft. is measured, or
40&nbsp;ft. from the bob, and another mark
made. The telescope is sighted on
it, and the location of the hand again
marked. This works well up to about
300&nbsp;ft., then the marks begin to come
very close together. This method is
used for laying out town sites. The
instrument is set up directly over a
stake from which to work, and the
telescope is turned down until the 20-ft.
mark is indicated, when the operator
looks through the telescope and
tells his helper where to set the stake.
Then another is driven at the next
point, and so on, until the limit of the
instrument is reached.
</p>

<p>
When doing railroad surveying several
start out together, one with an ax
to cut away brush; one to carry pegs;
two to measure, or chain, the distance
between stakes, and one to do the
sighting. In this manner a line can
be run that comes very near being perfectly
straight for three miles.
</p>

<p>
A concrete example of how the transit
was used to lay out a map of a
ranch will now be given. The start
was made on an east and west fence.
The instrument was set 5&nbsp;ft. from the
fence at one point, and at the other
end of the fence the stick was set at a
point 5&nbsp;ft. from the fence. When the
stick was sighted, the wire cut the E
and W on the compass, thus showing
that the fence was set on a line, due
east and west. The distance was
measured from the fence to the house,
which was 1/4 mile, and this was noted
in a book. This operation was repeated
on the rear, and the distance
found to be 780&nbsp;ft. while the compass
showed the direction to be 4&nbsp;deg.
west of south. The next line ran 427&nbsp;ft. and 1&nbsp;deg. east of south. This
was kept up all the way around. After
these notes had been obtained, it was
an easy matter to take a piece of plain
paper and strike a line representing
north and south and lay off the directions.
A bevel protractor was used to
find the degrees. The transit was set
on the posts of the corrals and this
saved the measuring out from the inclosure.
The creek was surveyed in
the same manner. So many feet south-west,
so many feet west, so many feet
5&nbsp;deg. south of west, and so on, until
its length was run.
</p>

<p>
The transit can also be used for finding
distances without measuring. A
line from A to B is sighted, and F
represents a point 1/2 mile distant, the
line from F to G being 100&nbsp;ft. A line
is now sighted from A, through G to C.
A person standing at D is directed to
move toward the point E and he is
stopped as soon as sighted in the telescope.
He then measures the distance
from D to E. Suppose this distance is
250&nbsp;ft. As each 100&nbsp;ft. means 1/2 mile,
and the 50&nbsp;ft., 1/4 mile, the point E is 1-1/4
miles from the transit. This method
can be used quite extensively and distances
obtained are fairly accurate.

<h2>
To Enlarge or Reduce Plots
</h2>


<p>
Sometimes it is necessary to enlarge
or reduce a plot to a different scale.
This can be easily and quickly accomplished
without resorting to the slow
process of protracting the angles and
scaling the individual lines.
</p>

  <p>Enlarging and Reducing Plots by Radial Lines from
a Common Point Located Properly</p>
</div>

<p>
Take any point, P, and from it draw
light pencil lines through each of the
corners of the plot. On any one of
these lines, as AP, lay off with dividers
AC equal to CP. Place a triangle on
the line AB and with a straightedge,
or another triangle, laid on the line
AP, slide the former to the point C,
then draw line CD parallel with AB
until it intersects the radial line PB.
In the same manner draw line DE
parallel with BF, and so on, all about
the plot. A test of accuracy will be
in striking the point C with the last
line. If the original plot has a scale
of 40&nbsp;ft. to the inch the reduced plot
would be 80&nbsp;ft. to the inch. If it is
required to enlarge the plot to 20&nbsp;ft.
to the inch, make AG equal to AP, and
proceed as in the first case, using G
as the starting point.
</p>

<p>
The location of the point P is
arbitrary and may be outside of the
boundary of the plot or figure to be
enlarged or reduced, but should be so
located, if possible, that the radial line
to any corner does not parallel either
of the plot lines to that corner. If the
point cannot be so located for all the
lines, it may be necessary to scale the
lines. A little practice in picking out
the best location for the point will give
gratifying results.&mdash;Contributed by

A Lathe Bench
</h2>


<p>
While working at a bench, or foot-power
lathe, it is quite convenient to
have some sort of a seat to sit on while
at work, or between operations. In
making such a seat, I used a board, 27&nbsp;in. long and 12&nbsp;in. wide, for the top,
and two boards, 19&nbsp;in. long and 12&nbsp;in.
wide, for the supports. These boards
were 3/4&nbsp;in. thick. The supports were
squared at the ends and securely fastened
to the top with nails, their positions
being 3&nbsp;in. in from the ends of
the top board. These were well
braced, as shown, and a cross board
was placed between them, near the
lower ends.

Cleaning and Polishing Shoes
</h2>


<p>
In using the polishes now on the
market for tan shoes, I found that the
leather cracked in an unreasonably
short time. The following was suggested
and tried out with good results.
Wash the shoes with castile soap and
water by applying the mixture with a
dauber. Work up a little lather and
then rub dry with a cloth, without
rinsing. The leather will be cleaned
without becoming dark, and it will not
crack. A higher polish may be obtained
by using some paste polish in
the usual manner.&mdash;Contributed by

  <p>The Mirror and Cabinet are Mounted on a Pedestal
That can be Moved as Desired</p>
</div>

<p>
The sidepieces of the cabinet are extended
at one corner, thereby forming
the supports for the mirror. The door
fits in between the sides and may be
attached either by hinges or two wood
screws, one on each side, holes being
bored in the sides forming a loose fit
for the screw so they can freely turn
with the door. The pedestal consists
of a 4-in. square box resting on the
base block, and secured in place by
means of molding strips. The sliding
support for the cabinet consists of a
2-in. square piece secured to the bottom
of the cabinet by means of molding,
and provided with a slot so the
support can freely slide over the clamp
bolt, which fastens it in place by
clamping it against the pedestal. If
it is desired to conceal the head of the
bolt, a recess should be made in the
pedestal frame for it, as shown, so the
support will freely slide over it. Before
assembling the pedestal it will be
necessary to drill a hole in the front
side in line with the recess of the back
side, and insert the bolt. If this precaution
is not taken, it will not be
possible to insert the bolt, unless a
hole be made for the head either
through the back side or front side.&mdash;Contributed

  <p>Coasting Is One of
the Best Sports a Boy
Enjoys during Winter, and
a Sled of Luxury Is Something
to Be Proud of among
Others on a Hill or Toboggan Slide</p>
</div>

<p>
Coaster bobs usually have about the same form
of construction, and only slight changes from the
ordinary are made to satisfy the builder. The one shown has
some distinctive features which make it a sled of luxury, and the
builder will pride himself in the making. A list of the materials
required is given on the opposite page. Any
wood may be used for the sled, except for the
runners, which should be made of ash.
</p>

<p>
Shape the runners all alike by cutting one out
and using it as a pattern to make the others.
After cutting them to the proper shape, a
groove is formed on the under edge to admit
the curve of a 5/8-in. round iron rod about
1/4&nbsp;in. deep. The iron rods are then
shaped to fit over the runner in the
groove and extend up the back part of
the runner and over the top at the
front end. The extensions should be
flattened so that two holes can be
drilled in them for two wood
screws at each end. If the builder
does not have the necessary
equipment for flattening these
ends, a local blacksmith can do
it at a nominal price. After the
irons are fitted, they are fastened
in place.
</p>

<p>
The top edges of the runners
are notched for the
crosspieces so that the top
surfaces of these pieces
will come flush with
the upper edges of the
runners. The location
of these
pieces is not essential,
but should
be near the ends
of the runners,
and the notches of
each pair of runners
should coincide.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>[25]</a></span>
When the notches are cut, fit in
the pieces snugly, and fasten them with
long, slim wood screws. Small metal
braces are then fastened to the runners
and crosspiece on the inside, to stiffen
the joint.

  <p>Details Showing the
Method of Rear-Sled
Oscillation,
the Bracing, and
the Steering Wheel</p>
</div>

<p>
As the rear sled must oscillate some,
means must be provided for this tilting
motion while at the same time preventing
sidewise turning. The construction
used for this purpose is a
hinged joint. The heavy 2 by 5-in.
crosspiece is cut sloping on the width
so that it remains 2&nbsp;in. thick at one
edge and tapers down to a feather edge
at the opposite side. This makes a
wedge-shaped piece, to which surface
the three large hinges are attached.
The piece is then solidly fastened to
the upper edges of the runners that
are to be used for the rear sled, and so
located that the center of the piece will
be 8&nbsp;in. from the front end of the
runners.
</p>

<p>
The supporting crosspiece on the
front sled is fastened on top of the
runners, at a place where its center
will be 11&nbsp;in. from the front end of the
runners.
</p>

<p>
The top board is prepared by making
both ends rounding and planing the
surfaces smooth. On the under side,
the two crosspieces are placed, which
should have two 1/2-in. holes bored
through the width of each, near the
ends, to receive the eyebolts. They are
placed, one with its center 12&nbsp;in. from
the end to be used for the rear, and the
other with its center 8&nbsp;in. from the
front end, and securely fastened with
screws. The shore is placed in the
center of the board, and wires are run
over it connecting the eyebolts. The
eyebolts are then drawn up tightly to
make the wire taut over the shore.
This will prevent the long board from
sagging.

run through this hole after first placing
two metal washers on it. After
running the stick through, a
collar is fastened to it just above the
top board, so that the top cannot be
raised away from the sled. At the
upper end of the broomstick a steering
wheel is attached, made from a nail-keg
hoop. A piece of wood is fastened
across its diameter, and the hoop
is covered with a piece of garden hose
and wrapped with twine. In the center
of the crosspiece, a hole is bored to
snugly fit on the broom handle, which
is then fastened with screws.

The rear sled is fastened to the top
board with screws through the extending
wings of the hinges and into the

front ends of all runners, and a chain
or rope is attached in them, the loop
end of the rear one being attached to
the under side of the top board, and the
one in the front used for drawing the sled.

An Ice Boat and Catamaran<br />
By Robert K. Patterson

<p>
This combination is produced by
using the regular type of ice boat
and substituting boats for the runners,
to make the catamaran.
</p>

<p>
In constructing the ice boat, use two
poles, or timbers, one 16&nbsp;ft. and the
other 10-1/2&nbsp;ft. long, crossed at a point
2-1/2&nbsp;ft. from
one end of the
longer timber.
The crossed
pieces are
firmly braced
with wires, as
shown.
</p>

<p>
The mast,
which should
be about 12&nbsp;ft.
long, is set
into a mortise
cut in the long
timber, 15&nbsp;in.
from the front
end, and is
further stabilized
by wires,
as shown. A
jib boom,
about 6&nbsp;ft.
long, as well
as a main
boom, which
is 11-1/2&nbsp;ft.
long, are hung
on the mast
in the usual
manner.

  <p>The Ice Boat Provides an Ideal Outing in Winter
Where There Is a Body of Water Large Enough for Sailing</p>
</div>

<p>
The front
runners consist
of band-iron strips, 18&nbsp;in. long, 3&nbsp;in. wide, and 1/8&nbsp;in. thick, with one edge
ground like the edge of a skate, and
the ends rounding, which are fastened
with bolts to the sides of wood pieces,
18&nbsp;in. long, 6&nbsp;in. wide, and 2&nbsp;in. thick,
allowing the ground edge to project
about 1&nbsp;inch.
</p>

<p>
When the ice-boat frame is made of
poles, the runners are attached to a
piece of wood, 12&nbsp;in. long, shaped as
shown and fastened at right angles
with bolts
running
through the
shouldered
part diagonally.
This makes
a surface on
which the
pole end rests
and where it
is securely
fastened with
bolts. If
squared timbers
are used,
the runners
can be fastened
directly
to them. The
rear, or guiding,
runner is

  <p>The Ice-Boat Details, Showing
Construction with Straight Poles
Having Detachable Runners So
the Boats can be Supplied in
Their Stead to Make a Sailing
Catamaran for Use in Summer</p>
</div>

<p>
A board is fastened on two crosspieces
mortised in the upper part of
the pole, for a place to sit on when
driving the boat. The sail can be constructed
of any good material to the
dimensions given.
</p>

<p>
To rig up the ice boat for use as a
catamaran, place a pole across the
stern, the length of the pole being
equal to the one used on the front part
of the ice boat. Two water-tight boats
are constructed, 16&nbsp;ft. long, 12&nbsp;in. wide,
and 10&nbsp;in. deep at the center. To make
these two boats procure six boards, 16&nbsp;ft. long, 10&nbsp;in. wide, and 1&nbsp;in. thick.
Three boards are used to make each
boat. Bend one board so that it will
be in an arc of a circle, then nail on
the two side boards, after which the
edges of the sides are cut away to the
shape of the bent board. The runners
are removed from the ice boat, and the
boats fastened to the pole ends. A
rudder is attached in the place of the
rear, or guiding, runner. The tops of
the boats, or floats, can be covered and
made water-tight.

<h2>
Mind-Reading Effect with Cards
</h2>


<p>
Five cards are shown, and some one
person is asked to think of two cards
in the lot, after which the performer
places the cards behind his back and
removes any two cards, then shows
the remaining three and asks if the
two cards in mind have been removed.
The answer is always yes, as it cannot
be otherwise.
</p>

<p>
To prepare the cards, take any 10
cards from the pack and paste the back
of one card to another, making five
double cards. Removing any two cards
behind the performer's back reduces
the number of cards to three, and when
these are turned over they will not
have the same faces so that the ones
first seen cannot be shown the second
time even though all five cards were
turned over and shown.

is fastened to the spout as shown.
</p>

<p>
The material for use in the pencil is
quick-drying mucilage thickened with
flake white. If some special color is
desired, tint the mixture with aniline.
Fill the spout with the mixture and
attach the bulb. Squeeze the bulb
gently while forming the letters, then
dust over with bronze, and allow to dry.

An Ice Glider<br />
By Mildred E. Thomas
</h2>


<p>
The enthusiastic pushmobilist need
not put aside his hobby during the
winter, as an amusement device
for use on ice, which will
surpass the very best pushmobile,
can be easily made as
shown in the illustration.

  <p>The Glider is Pushed over the Ice
Similarly to a Pushmobile, and the
Speed That can be Attained
is Much Greater</p>
</div>


<p>
Similar to an ice yacht, only
a great deal smaller, the ice
glider will require three ordinary
skates, two of which
are fastened to the ends of
the front crosspiece, so
that their blades will
stand at an angle of
about 30&nbsp;deg. with
their edges outward.
To get this angle,
tapering blocks
are fastened
to the crosspiece
ends,
as shown.
The skates
are then fastened
to
these blocks.

  <p>Detail of the Parts
for the Construction
of the Ice Glider,
or Pushmobile</p>
</div>

<p>
The crosspiece
is 30&nbsp;in. long and about 8&nbsp;in.
wide. In the center
of this piece
an upright is constructed,
26&nbsp;in.
high. The edges
of the front crosspiece
are cut on a
slant so that a
piece nailed to its
front and back
edge will stand
sloping toward
the rear. A handle,
24&nbsp;in. long, is
fastened between
the two uprights at the upper end.
The rear part is made of a board,
8&nbsp;in. wide and 40&nbsp;in. long. The
remaining skate is fastened in
a perfectly straight position on
the rear end. The skates may
be attached with screws run
through holes drilled in
the top plates, or with
straps. The front end
of the rear board has
a hole for a bolt to attach
it to the center
of the front crosspiece, so
that the latter
will turn
to guide the glider.
</p>

<p>
A pusher
is prepared
from a block
of wood, into
which nails
are driven
with their
ends projecting
on the
under side. The block is strapped to
one shoe, as
shown.

<p>
The pusher can
be made in another
way by using

are cut in the sides
for the straps.
Nails are driven
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>[32]</a></span>

<h2>
Prony Brake for Testing Small Motors
</h2>


<p>
The ordinary prony brake is not, as
a rule, sensitive enough to make an
accurate test on small motors, such as
those used in driving sewing machines,
washing machines, vacuum cleaners,
etc. The arrangement shown in the
accompanying sketch has been used for
this purpose with good results and
was very accurate. The operation of
the brake is exceedingly simple.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img032b'>

  </a>
  <p>Prony Brake Used in Connection with a Small
Balance to Find the Horsepower</p>
</div>

<p>
A pulley without a crown face is attached
to the shaft of the motor, which
is fastened to the top of a table or
bench, and a balance mounted directly
over the pulley. The support for the
balance should be a narrow strip, which
in turn is supported on two upright
pieces, as shown. A light rope is put
under the pulley, and the ends are
looped over the platforms of the balance
so that it does not interfere with
the operation of the balance. The ends
of the rope should be vertical and parallel.
The piece upon which the balance
rests is raised by inserting wedges,
thus increasing the tension in the rope.
The resulting friction of the rope on
the pulley increases the load.
</p>

<p>
If the motor is running in the direction
indicated by the arrow on the pulley,
the tension in the left-hand end
of the rope will be greater than in the
right-hand end and a weight must be
placed on the right-hand platform of
the balance. When the weight W is
adjusted so that the two pointers on
the platforms are exactly opposite each
other, the value of the weight W, in
pounds, will represent the difference in
pull, in pounds, between A and B. If
the value of the weight W is known
and also the speed of the machine when
the weight was determined, the horsepower
output can be computed by
means of the following equation:
</p>


<div class='center'>
<table summary='Equation'>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td><td class='c'>
      6.2832 &times; L &times; W &times; R.P.M.</td>

<tr>
<td>Hp. =</td><td><hr /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td><td class='c'>
           33,000 &times; 12</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>
In this equation, L is the distance in
inches from the center of the pulley to
the center of the rope. Two ordinary
spring balances may be substituted for
the beam balance and the difference in
their readings taken for the value W.
For best results, the tension in the
slack end of the rope should be as
small as possible, and it may be necessary
to wrap the rope one or more
times completely around the pulley.

<h2>
A Mystic Fortune Teller
</h2>


<p>
Fortune telling by means of weights
striking glasses or bottles is quite
mysterious if controlled in a manner
that cannot be seen by the audience.
The performer can arrange two strikes
for "no," and three for "yes" to answer
questions. Any kind of bottles,
glass, or cups may be used. In the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>[33]</a></span>

  <p>The Rocking of the Table is Caused by the
Pressure of Air in the Bulb under the Foot, the Movement Causing the
Pendulum to Swing and Strike the Glass</p>
</div>

<p>
The secret of the trick is as follows:
A rubber tube with a bulb attached to
each end is placed under a rug, one
bulb being located under one table leg
and the other near the chair of the performer
set at some distance from the
table where it can be pressed with the
foot. Some one selects a pendulum;
the performer gazes intently at it, and
presses the bulb under his foot lightly
at first; then, by watching the swaying
of the pendulum selected, he will
know when to give the second impulse,
and continue until the weight strikes
the glass. As the pendulums are of
different lengths they must necessarily
swing at different rates per second.
The impulses must be given at the
proper time or else the pendulum will
be retarded instead of increased in
amplitude. A table with four legs is
best to use, and the leg diagonally opposite
that with the bulb beneath it
must not touch the carpet or floor.
This can be arranged by placing pieces
of cardboard under the other two legs.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Snowshoes: How to Make and Use Them<br />
By Stillman Taylor
</h2>


<h3>
Part I&mdash;Shapes of Snowshoes
</h3>


<p>
To the inventive mind of the North
American Indian we owe the
snowshoe, and its conception was
doubtless brought about through that
prolific source of invention&mdash;necessity.
The first models were crude web-footed
affairs, but improvements in model
and manner of filling the frames were
gradually added until the perfected
and graceful shoe of the present was
finally reached. The first snowshoes
were made by the Indians, and the
Indians of Maine and Canada continue
to fashion the finest models today.
</p>

<p>
The snowshoe is a necessity for the
sportsman and trapper whose pleasure
or business leads him out in the open
during the winter season, when roads
and trails are heavily blanketed by a
deep fall of powdery snow. But the
use of the web shoe is by no means
confined to the dweller in the wilderness,
since the charm of wintry wood
and plain beckons many lovers of the
outdoors to participate in this invigorating
sport, and snowshoe tramps are
fast growing in popularity in and
about our cities and towns.
</p>

<p>
All the modern snowshoes are constructed
upon practically the same
general lines, although the types of
frames differ considerably in size as
well as in shape, and the filling of hide
is often woven in many varied and intricate
patterns. The frame or bow&mdash;usually
made of ash in order to get
strength with light weight&mdash;is bent in
many shapes, but the one shown in the
diagram is a typical general-purpose
shoe, and may be called standard. The
frame is held in shape by means of
two wooden cross braces, neatly mortised
into the frame. These braces
are spaced some 15 or 16&nbsp;in. apart, and
so divide the shoe into three sections,
known as the toe, center, and heel.
The filling is woven into a lanyard,
which is a light strip of hide firmly
laced to the frame through a double
row of holes drilled in the wood. The
center filling is woven of heavy strands
of rawhide, in a fairly coarse mesh, because
this part of the shoe must bear
the weight of the body and the brunt
of wear. The end fillers for toe and
heel are woven of lighter strands of
hide, and the mesh is, of course, smaller.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img037'>

  </a>
  <p>The Frame of a Snowshoe in Its Usual
Construction, Showing the Crosspieces with Their Laced Fillings of Hide
and the Different Parts Named, for a Ready Reference</p>
</div>

<p>
As may be noted by referring to the
drawing, a center opening or "toe
hole" is provided, and as the greater
strain on the filling lies directly under
the ball of the foot, the shoe is reinforced
at this point by the "toe cord"
running across, and the "toe-cord
stays," which are tied in on each side
of the toe hole&mdash;one end being fastened
to the toe cord and the other lashed
over the wooden cross bar of the
frame. These reinforcing cords are
formed of several strands of hide, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>[36]</a></span>
stays being again wound with finer strands.
</p>

<p>
To prevent slipping and to secure a
good foothold while walking, the manner
of attaching the foot to the shoe is
of importance, and this is done by
making use of a toe strap, which will
allow the toe to push down through
the toe opening as the heel of the foot
is lifted in the act of walking. A second
strap, or thong, leading from the
top around the foot, above the curve of
the heel, is needed to lend additional
support in lifting the snowshoe, to effect
the easy shambling stride characteristic
of the snowshoer.
</p>

<p>
There are, of course, a great number
of models or styles, some one style
being popular in one locality, while an
altogether different style is preferred
in another part of the country. The
most representative types are well
shown in the illustrations, and a brief
description will point out their practical
advantages, because each model
possesses certain merits&mdash;one model
being designed for fast traveling in
the open, another better adapted for
brush travel, while others are more
convenient for use in a hilly country
where much climbing is done, and so on.

  <p>A: Snowshoe Experts Regard This
as an Extreme Style, for It
is Long and Narrow</p>
</div>

<p>
Style A is regarded by snowshoe experts
as an extreme style, for it is long
and narrow. It is designed for fast
traveling over smooth and level country,
and over loose, powdery snow.
This style is much used by the Cree
Indians, and is usually made 12&nbsp;in.
wide by 60&nbsp;in. long, with a deeply upcurved
toe. It is a good shoe for
cross-country work, but is somewhat
difficult to manage on broken trails,
when the snow is packed, and also affords
rather slippery footing when
crossing ice. Owing to the stout construction
of the frame and reinforcement
needed to retain the high, curved
toe, style A is more difficult to manage
than the more conservative models,
and its stiffness of frame makes it
more fatiguing to wear, while its use
is a decided handicap in mountainous
districts, because a curved toe always
makes hill climbing more difficult.

  <p>B: This Snowshoe is Considered
the Ordinary Eastern Model
and One Best Adapted for
All-Around Use</p>
</div>

<p>
Style B may be considered the ordinary
eastern model, and a common
style best adapted for all-around use.
It is a neat and gracefully designed
frame, about 12&nbsp;in. wide and 42&nbsp;in.
long, and is usually made with a
slightly upcurving toe, about 2&nbsp;in. turn
at the toe being correct. When made
by the Indians of Maine, this model is
fashioned with a rather heavy heel,
which is an advantage for fast walking,
while it increases the difficulty in
quick turning.

  <p>C: The Style
Illustrated Here
is Splendid
for General
Purposes and is
a Favorite
among Hunters
and Woodsmen</p>
</div>

<p>
Style C is a favorite model among
the hunters and woodsmen of New
England. This is a splendid style for
general purposes in this section of the
country, since the full, round toe keeps
the toe up near the surface, and lets
the heel cut down more than the narrow-toe
models. Style C is an easy
shoe to wear, and while not so fast as
the long, narrow frame, its full shape
is more convenient for use in the
woods. It is usually made with about
1 to 1-1/2-in. turn at the toe.

  <p>D: This is the Familiar "Bear's-Paw"
Model, Originated by
the Northeastern Trapper for
Use on Short Tramps and
in Brush</p>
</div>

<p>
Style D is the familiar "bear's
paw," a model originating with the
northeastern trapper. This model is
well adapted for short tramps in the
brush, and having a flat toe, is likewise
a good shoe for mountain climbing.
For tramping about in thick brush, a
short, full shoe enables one to take a
shorter stride and turn more quickly,
but it is a slow shoe for straight-ahead
traveling.
</p>

<p>
When purchasing a pair of snowshoes,
some few important considerations
should be kept in mind, and the
size and model will depend upon the
man to some extent, since a large,
heavy man will require a larger snowshoe
than would suffice for a person of
lighter weight. Height also enters
into the choice, and while a small person
can travel faster and with less
fatigue when equipped with a proportionately
small shoe, a tall man will
naturally pick out a larger-sized snowshoe
for his use. For a country where
deep snows prevail, larger sizes are
best, but in localities where the snow
packs solidly and there is considerable
ice, and in mountainous districts,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>[37]</a></span>
or for rough-country traveling, the
smaller sizes will give more satisfaction
and prove more durable also. For
a wet-snow locality, the center filling
should be strung in rather coarse mesh,
while for soft, powdery snow, a finer
mesh will be the logical choice.
</p>

<p>
There are snowshoes and snowshoes,
and while there are fine models
regularly stocked by a few of the better
sporting-goods
firms, there is likewise
a deal of poorly made
snowshoes on the market.
It is well to pay
a fair price and secure
a dependable
handmade article, for
the cheaper snowshoes&mdash;often
filled with
seine twine and the
cheapest hide (commonly
known in the
trade as "gut")&mdash;will
warp and twist in the
frame, and the shoddy
filling will soon become
loosened up and
"bag" after a little use.
The best snowshoes
that the writer is acquainted
with are made
by the Indians, and
the filling is ordinarily
made of neat's hide;
cowhide for the center
filling, and calfskin for
the toe and heel. A
first-class pair of snowshoes
may be had for
about $6 to $7.50, and
when possible to do so,
it is best to have them
made to order. This
plan is, of course,
necessary in case one wishes to incorporate
any little wrinkles of his own
into their making, or desires a flatter
toe, lighter heel, or a different mesh
from the usual stock models.
</p>

<p>
Where but one pair of snowshoes is
purchased, style B will probably prove
the best selection, and should be ordered
with the flat toe, or a turn not
greater than 1&nbsp;in. The frame may be
in either one or two pieces, depending
upon the size of the shoe and the ideas
of the Indian maker, but it is well to
specify white ash for the frames in the
order. No Indian maker would be
guilty of using screws or other
metal fastenings, but many of the
cheap and poorly fashioned snowshoes
are fastened at the heel with screws,
thus making this a decidedly weak
point, since the wood is quite certain
to split after a little rough service.
In contrast to the poor workmanship
of these low-priced snowshoes, the
Indian-made article is fashioned from
sound and properly seasoned wood;
the cross bars are snugly fitted by
mortising to the frame; the filling is
tightly woven, and the heel is properly
fastened by lacing with a rawhide
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>[38]</a></span>
it is a good idea to
select a filling of good
heavy weight and with
a firmly woven and
open mesh, say, about
3/4&nbsp;in. The toe and
heel sections will, of
course, be of finer-cut
hide and smaller mesh,
and it is wise to avoid
those shoes employing
seine twine for the end
filling. Some factory-made
snowshoes are
given a coat or two of
varnish, but this, while
serving to make them
partly waterproof,
makes them rather
slippery when crossing
logs and ice. Most
woodsmen prefer to
leave both frame and
filling in their natural condition.
</p>

<p>
The Indian-made
snowshoe is always
thong. However, Indian
makers are likely
to make the toe small
and leave the wood to
form a rather heavy
heel. Some few
woodsmen and sportsmen
may prefer this
model, but the majority
favor a fuller toe
and a lighter heel for
general use, because
the regulation Indian
model, cutting down at
toe and heel equally
deep, increases the difficulty
of easy traveling
over soft snow, although
it is a good
shoe when used over
broken trails.
</p>

<p>
When buying snowshoes
at the store, see
that the frames are
stoutly and well made,
and for all-around use,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>[39]</a></span>
provided with a generously
large toe hole, so
that ample foot covering
may be used. This
point is generally overlooked
in the machine-made
product, and the
toe cords are also
frequently roughly
formed, thus chafing
the feet and making
them sore. These details
may or may not
prove a handicap for
short tramps near
town, but for long
trips through the
woods, they are important
considerations.
</p>

<p>
The Indian manner
of tying the snowshoe
to the foot by means of
a single twisted and
knotted thong is a
good method of attachment,
in that, if the
thong is properly adjusted
to the requisite
snugness in the first
place, the shoes may
be quickly removed by
a simple twist of the
ankle. A better fastening
is secured by using
a fairly wide (3/4&nbsp;in.)
toe strap and a long
thong. The toe strap
is placed over the toes,
immediately over the
ball of the foot, and secured
against slipping
by weaving the ends in
and out between the
meshes of the filling until
it reaches the frame
on either side. This
grips the toe strap
firmly and does away
with the necessity of
tying a knot. A narrow
thong, about 4&nbsp;ft.
long, is now doubled,
the center placed just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>[40]</a></span>
above the heel of the foot, and the
ends passed under the toe cord, just
outside of the toe-cord stays on each
side. The thong is then brought up
and across the toes, one end passing
over and the other under the toe
strap. Each end of the thong is now
looped around the crossed thong, on
either side, and then carried back over
the back of the heel and knotted with
a common square or reef knot. Calfskin
makes a good flexible foot binding,
or a suitable strip of folded cloth
or canvas may be used.
</p>

<p>
The regulation snowshoe harness,
consisting of a leather stirrup for the
toe and an instep and heel strap, will
be found more comfortable than the
thong, and when once adjusted snugly
to the foot, the shoes may be quickly
taken off and put on again by pushing
the heel strap down, when the foot may
be slipped out of the toe stirrup.
</p>

<p>
The use of heavy leather shoes is of
course undesirable, and the only correct
footwear for snowshoeing is a pair
of high-cut moccasins, cut roomy
enough to allow one or more pairs of
heavy woolen stockings to be worn.
The heavy and long German socks, extending
halfway to the knee, drawn
on over the trouser legs, are by far the
most comfortable for cold-weather
wear. The feet, thus shod, will not
only be warm in the coldest weather,
but the free use of the toes is not interfered
with. Leather shoes are cold
and stiff, and the heavy soles and
heels, chafing against the snowshoes,
will soon ruin the filling.

<h2>
Soldering and Riveting<br />
By John D. Adams
</h2>


<p>
There are two simple processes that
every experimenter should master:
soldering and riveting. The large soldering
copper will find only a very restricted
use with the amateur on account
not only of its clumsiness, but of
the fact that it requires a fire, which
is often impracticable to obtain. The
experimenter should therefore construct
a small alcohol lamp, which,
after a little experience, will reveal the
following advantages: It may be
brought into instant use at any place;
it will make a more perfect connection;
with a small blowpipe places may be
reached that are entirely inaccessible
to the large iron; several small pieces
may be set in position and soldered
without disturbing them, which is
quite impossible with the large iron.
</p>

<div class='imgfr' id='img040b'>
  <img src='images/img040b.png'
  alt='img040b'
  title='img040b'
  />
  <p>(alcohol lamp)</p>
</div>

<p>
To make such a lamp, procure a
small wide-mouthed bottle so that very
little alcohol will be necessary and the
lamp may be tipped at any desired
angle. A short piece of seamless brass
tubing should be procured, or, preferably,
one of those capped brass cylinders
for holding pencil leads, the button
of which should be sawn off and
the cap used to keep the alcohol from
evaporating. A good, sound cork is
next in order, and in cutting the central
hole, use the brass tube, which should
be sharpened around the lower end.
Proceed with a rotary motion, and a
clean core will be removed. If an ordinary
lamp wick is not at hand, soft
cotton string
may be bundled
up as a substitute.
Such a
lamp is safe,
odorless and will
not blacken the
work in the least
as in the case of
kerosene or gasoline.
</p>

<p>
There are many good soldering
fluxes on the market, but that obtained
by dissolving as much scrap of zinc
as possible in muriatic acid will solder
practically everything that may be
necessary, provided, of course, the surfaces
are filed or scraped bright. Wire
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>[41]</a></span>
solder is usually the most convenient,
as small pieces can be readily cut off
and placed directly on the work where
required. A small blowpipe is often
a valuable adjunct, as it makes possible
a long, narrow flame that may be
directed in almost any direction.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img040a'>
  <img src='images/img040a.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>A Small Torch Made of a Penholder is Handy to
Use in Soldering Electrical Apparatus</p>
</div>

<p>
Where numerous small connections
are to be made, as is often the case with
electrical apparatus, the small torch
illustrated will be found very convenient.
It is simply an old penholder
with the wood portion shortened
somewhat  and
the metal end
filed off square
and cleaned out.
This is then
filled with wicking, and it is only necessary
to dip it in alcohol in order to
soak up enough to solder an ordinary
connection.
</p>

<p>
The second simple process, of which
many fail to appreciate the usefulness
in experimental work, is that of riveting&mdash;particularly
when done on a small
scale. Very often the material in hand
is tempered steel and cannot, therefore,
be soldered to advantage, or it may be
a case where subsequent heating makes
a heat-proof connection imperative.
Then, again, the joint may require the
combined strength of both solder and
rivet.
</p>

<p>
When properly set, the strength of
the ordinary brass pin, when used as
a rivet, is quite great. Should the
work require a particularly soft rivet,
it is only necessary to hold the pin for
a moment in the flame of a match. A
somewhat larger and stronger rivet
may be made by softening and cutting
to the required length the small flat-headed
nails used in making cigar
boxes. The ordinary shingle nail is
also of a suitable shape after the burrs
have been filed off under the head.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img041a'>
  <img src='images/img041a.png' alt='img041a' title='img041a' />
</div>

<p>
In setting these small rivets, it is
absolutely necessary that they closely
fit the holes, as at A, otherwise the result
will be as indicated at B in the
sketch. Be careful not to leave too
great a length for rounding over on the
metal. This extra length should approximately
equal the diameter of the
rivet and must be filed flat on the top
before riveting. In case of pins, it will
be found easier to cut them off to the
proper length after they are inserted.
Use the smallest hammer available,
striking many light blows rather than
a few heavy ones.

<p>
With but little skill, and such tools
as are ordinarily found around a home,
a plain but serviceable costumer can be
made, as shown
in the sketch.
The necessary
materials for it
are: One main
post, 1-1/2&nbsp;in.
square and about
6-1/2&nbsp;ft. long; four
legs, or foot
brackets, 3/4 by 6
by 9&nbsp;in.; four
brass clothes
hooks, and the
necessary screws
and varnish for
assembling and
finishing.
</p>

<p>
The center
post should be
chamfered at the
top to relieve the
abruptness. The
four legs should
all be made alike
and in some
shape that allows
them to be fastened
to the post in a simple manner.
In the sketch, the legs are fastened to
the post by one visible screw at the top
and one put in on an incline through
the bottom edge of the leg. The clothes
hooks are fastened to the post in pairs
at different heights, thereby preventing
the screws of adjacent hooks from running
into one another. The finish of
the costumer should be such as to
match the woodwork of its surroundings.&mdash;Contributed

one catch is used and fastened in the
center, it is best to mark it off first, and
then pull the table ends apart to fasten
the catch more easily. It may be desired
to use two catches for a very

<h2>
Snowshoes: How to Make and Use Them<br />
By Stillman Taylor
</h2>


<h3>
Part II&mdash;Making the Shoe
</h3>



<div class='blkquot'>
<p>
[In making the snowshoe it may be necessary to refer to the previous
chapter to select the style, or to locate the name of the parts used in the
description.&mdash;Editor.]
</p>
</div>

<p>
Snowshoe making
is an art, and
while few, if any,
white men can equal
the Indian in weaving the intricate patterns
which they prefer to employ for filling
the frames, it is not very difficult to
fashion a good solid frame and then fill it
by making use of a simple and open system
of meshing. For the frames, white ash is
much the best wood, but hickory and white
birch are dependable substitutes, if the
former cannot be obtained. Birch is perhaps
the best wood to use when the sportsman
wishes to cut and split up his own
wood, but as suitable material for the
frames may be readily purchased for a
small sum, probably the majority of the
readers will elect to buy the material. Any
lumber dealer will be able to supply white
ash, and it is a simple matter to saw out
the frames from the board. The sawed-out
frame is inferior to the hand-split bow, but
if good, selected material can be obtained,
there will be little, if any, difference for
ordinary use.
</p>

<p>
When dry and well-seasoned lumber is
used, the frame may be made to the
proper dimensions, but when green
wood is selected, the frame must be
made somewhat heavier, to allow for
the usual shrinkage in seasoning. For
a stout snowshoe frame, the width
should be about 1-1/16&nbsp;in.; thickness at
toe, 7/16&nbsp;in., and thickness at heel, 9/16&nbsp;in.
The frame should be cut 2&nbsp;in. longer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>[44]</a></span>
than the finished length desired, and
in working the wood, remember that
the toe of the finished frame will be the
center of the
stick; the heel,
the end of the
stick, and the
center of the
shoe will lie halfway
between the
heel and toe.

</div>

<p>
After the
frames have
been finished,
the dry wood
must be steamed
before it can be safely bent to the required
shape, and before doing this, a
wooden bending form must be made.
An easy way to make this form is to
first draw a pattern of the model on a
sheet of paper, cut out the pencil mark,
and, placing this pattern on a board,
carefully trace the design on the
wooden form. A number of cleats, or
blocks, of wood will now be needed;
the inside blocks being nailed in position,
but the outside stay blocks being
simply provided with nails in the holes,
so they may be quickly fastened in
position when the steamed frame is
ready for the form.
</p>

<p>
To make the frame soft for bending
to shape, steaming must be resorted to,
and perhaps the easiest way of doing
this is to provide boiling water in a
wash boiler, place the wood over the
top, and soak well by mopping with
the boiling water, shifting the stick
about until the fibers have become soft
and pliable. After 10 or 15 minutes of
the hot-water treatment, wrap the stick
with cloth and bend it back and forth
to render it more and more pliable, then
use the hot-water treatment, and repeat
the process until the wood is sufficiently
soft to bend easily without
splintering. The toe being the greatest
curve, must be well softened before
putting on the form, otherwise the
fibers are likely to splinter off at this
point. When the frame is well softened,
place it on the bending form
while hot, slowly bend it against the
wooden inside blocks, and nail on the
outside blocks to hold it to the proper
curve. Begin with the toe, and after
fastening the outside blocks to hold
this end, finish one side, then bend the
other half to shape. The bent frame
should be allowed to dry on the form
for at least a week; if removed before
the wood has become thoroughly dry
and has taken a permanent set, the
frame will not retain its shape. The
same bending form may be used for
both frames, but if one is in a hurry
to finish the shoes, two forms should be
made, and considerable pains must be
taken to make them exactly alike in
every way.

  <p>Locate the Cross Bars
by Balancing the Frame,
Then Fit the Ends in
Shallow Mortises</p>
</div>

<p>
When the frames are dry, secure the
tail end of the frame by boring three
holes about 4&nbsp;in. from the end, and
fasten with rawhide. The work of fitting
the two cross bars may now be
undertaken, and the balance of the
snowshoe depends upon fitting these
bars in their proper places. Before
cutting the mortise, spring the two
bars in the frame about 15&nbsp;in. apart, and
balance the shoe in the center by holding
it in the hands. When the frame
exactly balances, move the bars sufficiently
to make the heel about 3&nbsp;oz.
heavier than the toe, and mark the
place where the mortises are to be cut.
The cross bars and mortise must be a
good tight fit, and a small, sharp chisel
will enable the builder to make a neat
job. It is not necessary to cut the
mortise very deep; 1/4&nbsp;in. is ample to
afford a firm and snug mortised joint.

holes. Three holes are then bored in
the cross bar&mdash;one on each side about
1-1/2&nbsp;in. from the frame, and the third
in the center of the bar; the lanyard
being carried through these holes in the
cross bar.

  <p>Begin Weaving the Toe Filling at the Corner of
Cross Bar and Frame, Carrying It Around
in a Triangle until Complete</p>
</div>

<p>
Begin the toe filling first, by making
an eye in one end of the thong, put the
end through the lanyard loop and then
through the eye, thus making a slipknot.
Start to weave at the corner where the
bar and frame are mortised, carry the
strand up and twist it around the lanyards
in the middle of the toe, then carry
it down and make a like twist around
the lanyard loop in the opposite corner.
The thong is now looped around the
next lanyard (No. 2 from the crossbar
lanyard) and fastened with the
twisted loop knot illustrated. Continue
the strand across the width of toe
space and make a similar loop knot on
No. 2 lanyard on the starting side,
twist it around the strand first made
and loop it under the next cross-bar
lanyard loop, then carry it up and twist
it around the lanyard loop in the toe
of the frame, continuing in the same
manner until the last lanyard of the toe
is reached, when the space is finished
by making the twisted loop knot until
the space is entirely filled. It is a difficult
matter to describe by text, but
the illustrations will point out the
correct way, and show the manner of
making an endless thong by eye-splicing,
as well as illustrating the wooden
bodkin or needle used in pulling the
woven strands taut. This bodkin is
easily made from a small piece of wood,
about 1/4&nbsp;in. thick, and about 2&nbsp;in. long.
To simplify matters, the heel may be
filled in the same manner as the toe.

<p>
For the center, which must be woven
strong and tight, a heavier strand of
hide must be used. Begin with the
toe cord first, and to make this amply
strong, carry the strand across the
frame five or six times, finishing with
a half-hitch knot, as shown, then carry
it up and twist it around the cross bar
to form the first toe-cord stay.

  <p>The Heel Filling is Woven by Making the Connection

</div>

<p>
As may be noted, the center section
is filled by looping back and twisting
the strands as when filling the toe.
However, the filling is looped around
the frame instead of a lanyard, and a
clove hitch is used. A toe hole, 4&nbsp;in.
wide, must be provided for, and when
enough of the filling has been woven
in to make this opening, the thong is
no longer looped around the cross bar,
but woven through the toe cord. As
the filling ends in the toe cord, it should
be woven in and out at this point several
times, finishing the toe hole by
looping a strand around the cross bar
at the side of the toe hole, then passing
it down the toe-cord stay by twisting
around it; then twisted around the
toe cord along the filling to the other
side of the toe hole, where it is twisted
around the toe-cord stay on the opposite
side, looped around the frame and
ended in a clove hitch.

At the first reading, it will doubtless
appear difficult, but a careful examination
of the illustrations will soon show
how the trick is done, and indeed it is
really a very simple matter, being one
of those things which are easier to do
than it is to tell how to do them. The
method of filling has been purposely
made simple, but the majority of shoes
are filled in practically the same manner,
which answers quite as well as the
more intricate Indian design.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>[46]</a></span>
The knack of using the snowshoe is
quickly mastered, providing the shoes
are properly attached, to allow the toe
ample freedom to work down through
the toe hole as each foot is lifted. The
shoe is, of course, not actually lifted in
the air, but rather slid along the surface,
half the width of one shoe covering
the other when it is lifted in the act
of walking. At first the novice may be
inclined to think snowshoes a bit cumbersome
and unwieldy, and doubt his
ability to penetrate the brush. However,
as the snowshoer becomes accustomed
to their use, he will experience
little if any difficulty in traveling where
he wills. When making a trail in a
more or less open country, it is a good
plan to blaze it thoroughly, thus enabling
one to return over the same
trail, in case a fall of snow should occur
in the meantime, or drifting snow fill
up and obliterate the trail first made.
When the trail is first broken by traveling
over it once by snowshoe, the snow
is packed well and forms a solid foundation,
and even should a heavy fall
of snow cover it, the blaze marks on
tree and bush will point out the trail,
which will afford faster and easier
traveling than breaking a new trail
each time one journeys in the same direction.
</p>

<p>
A well-made pair of snowshoes will
stand a couple of seasons' hard use, or
last for a year or two longer for general
wear. To keep them in good
shape, they should be dried out after
use, although it is never advisable to
place them close to a hot fire, or the
hide filling will be injured. Jumping
puts severe strain on the frame of the
shoe, and while damage may not occur
when so used in deep, soft snow, it is
well to avoid the possibility of breakage.
Accidents will now and then
happen, to be sure, and as a thong may
snap at some unexpected moment, keep
a strand or two of rawhide on hand,
to meet this emergency.

piece of furniture can be made,
which may be used either as a regular

keep the frame in position while serving
as a cradle front, or when turned
down for regular use, screw hooks are
placed at each end, so that, in the former
case, the frame, when swung up,
can be secured in place by attaching

<p>
The substitute, which is called a
snowball thrower, consists of a base,
A, with a standard, B, which stops the
arm C, controlled by the bar D, when
the trigger E is released. The tripping
of the trigger is accomplished by the
sloping end of D on the slanting end
of the upright F. Sides, G, are fastened
on the piece F, with their upper
ends extending above the bar D, to
prevent the latter from jumping out
when it is released by the trigger.
</p>

<p>
The trigger E is tripped with the
handle H, connected to the piece J, on
which all the working parts are
mounted. The upper end of the arm
C has a piece, K, to which is attached a
tin can, L, for holding the snowball to
be thrown. A set of door springs, M,
furnishes the force to throw the snowball.

How to Make a Monorail Sled
</h2>


<p>
A monorail sled, having a simple
tandem arrangement of the runners, is
very easily constructed as follows:
The runners are cut from 1-in. plank
of the size and shape given in the
sketch, and are shod with strap iron,
1&nbsp;in. wide and 1/4&nbsp;in. thick. Round iron
or half-round iron should not be used,
as these are liable to skid. The square,
sharp edges of the strap iron prevent
this and grip the surface just as a
skate.

<p>
The top is a board 6&nbsp;ft. long and 1&nbsp;in. thick, securely fastened to the runners
as follows: Blocks are nailed, or
bolted, on either side of the upper edge
of the rear runner and the top is
fastened to them with screws. The
runner is also braced with strap iron,
as shown. The same method applies
to the front runner, except that only
one pair of blocks are used at the center
and a thin piece of wood fastened
to their tops to serve as the fifth wheel.

  </a>
  <p>The Construction is Much More Simple Than
Making a Double-Runner Bobsled</p>
</div>

<p>
The hole for the steering post should
be 6&nbsp;in. from the front end and a little
larger in diameter than the steering
post. The latter should be rounded
where it passes through the hole, but
square on the upper end to receive the
steering bar, which must be tightly
fitted in place.
</p>

<p>
In coasting, the rider lies full length
on the board with his hands on the
steering bar. This makes the center
of gravity so low that there is no necessity
for lateral steadying runners, and
aside from the exhilarating glide of
the ordinary sled, the rider experiences
a buoyant sense of freedom and a zest
peculiar to the monorail type. Then,
too, the steering is effected much more
easily. Instead of dragging the feet, a
slight turn of the front runner with a
corresponding movement of the body
is sufficient to change the direction or
to restore the balance. This latter is,
of course, maintained quite mechanically,
as everyone who rides a bicycle
well knows.&mdash;Contributed by Harry

three equal distances, or, perhaps, the
center space longer than the other two.
Make two holes through all the magazines
on the marks with an awl, or
drill, then drive nails of the right length
through them. Use small washers on
both ends of the nails under the head
and at the point, which is cut off and
riveted over. This makes a good, serviceable
binding for rough use.&mdash;Contributed

<p>
Take a wide window shade and attach
it to a roller as if hanging it to
a window. Cut it to about 3&nbsp;ft. in
length, hem the lower edge and insert
in the slot in the usual manner. Procure
some black slate paint and cover
the shade on one side, giving it two
coats. Allow sufficient time for the
first coat to dry before applying the
second coat.

How to Make a Ski Staff
</h2>


<p>
A ski staff will greatly assist progress
over level stretches and is an aid
to the ski runner in preserving his
balance. A homemade staff that is
easy to construct is shown in Fig.&nbsp;1.
At the upper end is a narrow leather
loop for the wrist; at the extreme
lower end a spike is placed for use on
icy ground, and just above this spike
is a disk, or stop, which, in deep snow,
prevents the staff from sinking in too
far and gives the necessary leverage
for steering, propelling or righting
oneself as needed.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img051b'>

  <p>The Staff, being Made of
a Bamboo Pole, is Strong as Well as Light (Fig.&nbsp;1, Fig.&nbsp;2,
Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
The staff is made of a piece of bamboo
pole, 1-1/4 or 1-1/2&nbsp;in. in diameter,
and 4-1/2&nbsp;ft. long. The leather for the
loop can be made from an old strap,
shaved down thinner and cut to a
width of about 1/2&nbsp;in. The stop is a
disk of wood, 1/2&nbsp;in. thick and 5&nbsp;in. in
diameter. This material should be
well-seasoned white pine or spruce and
coated with shellac. A hole is bored
through the center of the disk to let
it pass upward on the staff about 6&nbsp;in. Here it is fastened with two
pieces of heavy wire, A and B, Fig.
2. In this diagram, C is the staff, and
D, the stop or disk. The wire A passes
through the staff below the wire B and
at right angles to it, wherefore the
wire B must be bent as shown. Both
wires are fastened to the stop with
staples.
</p>

<p>
The lower end of the staff, as shown
in Fig.&nbsp;3, is plugged with hard wood,
which is bored part way through its
center to admit a wire spike. Slight
recesses are made in the sides of this
hole to anchor the lead which is
poured in around the spike. The point
of the latter is sharpened and then the
bamboo wound with waxed twine, or
fine wire, to prevent its splitting.

A Game Played on the Ice
</h2>


<p>
A novel and interesting winter game
for young and old, described as a

as follows:
</p>

  <p>A Player in Action Ready to Spear a Ring that
Hangs on the Line between the Poles</p>
</div>

<p>
Two poles of convenient height are
erected on the ice; if skating on a
shallow pond they may be driven
through the ice and into the ground,
but if the water is deep, holes must be
bored through the ice and the poles
will soon freeze solidly in them. A
rope is stretched between the poles at
such a height as is suited to the size
of the players, or as agreed on to make
the game more or less difficult, and on
this are strung a number of pieces of
board, A, each having a ring of spring
steel, B, attached to its lower end. The
purpose of the game is to run at good
speed between the poles and catch a
ring on a spear, each player being entitled
to make a certain number of
runs, and the winner being the one
who can catch the most rings.
</p>

<p>
The spears may be made of broom
handles tapered toward one end, and
with a shield made of tin and attached
at a suitable distance from the thicker
end (Pattern C). The line is fastened
at the top of one pole and run through
a pulley, D, at the top of the other,
thence to a weight or line fastener.
Each player should start from the same
base line and pass between the poles at
such a speed that he will glide at least
100&nbsp;ft. on the other side of the poles
without pushing himself forward by
the aid of the skates. Twenty runs are
usually allowed each player, or 10 players
may divide into two parties, playing
one against the other, etc. An umpire
will be needed to see that fair
play is maintained and settle any disputes
that may arise.

<h2>
An Electric Display for a Show Window
</h2>


<p>
A novel window display that is very
attractive, yet simple in construction
and operation, can be made in the following
manner: First, make a small
watertight chamber, A, as long as the
focal length of the lens to be used, and
having a glass window, B, at one end,
and a small round opening, C, at the
other. In this opening is placed a cork
through which a glass tube about 2&nbsp;in.
long is inserted. The tube makes a
smooth passage for the stream of water
flowing out of the box. Water from
any source of supply enters the
chamber through the tube D, which
may be a pipe or hose, whichever is
most convenient. The interior is
painted a dull black.
</p>

<p>
A convenient and compact light is
placed at the window end of the box.
A very good light can be made by placing
an electric light with a reflector in
a closed box and fastening a biconvex
lens, F, in the side facing the window
of the water box. When the electric
light and the water are turned on, the
light is focused at the point where the
water is issuing from the box, and follows
the course of the stream of water,
illuminating it in a pleasing manner.

<p>
Two or three streams of water flowing
in different colors make a very

Even though a milker may be careful,
small particles of dirt, hairs, etc.,
will fall into the
milk pail. It is
true that the
milk is strained
afterward, but a
large percentage
of the dirt dissolves
and passes
through the
strainer along
with the milk.
The best plan to prevent this dirt from
falling into the milk is to put a piece
of cheesecloth over the pail opening,
securing it there by slipping an open
wire ring, A, over the rim. The milk
will readily pass through the cloth
without spattering.&mdash;Contributed by

Baking Bread in Hot Sand

A driving crew on the river wanted
to move camp, but the cook objected
as he had started to bake. One of the
party suggested using a modified form
of the method of baking in vogue more
than a century ago, which was to place
the dough in the hot earth where a
fire had been burning. So, to help
the cook out, a barrel was sawed in
half and the bread, after being properly
protected, was placed in each half barrel
and covered with hot sand. Two of
the men carried the half barrels on
their backs. When the new camp was
reached the bread was done.&mdash;Contributed

If the luster of coins fresh from the
mint is to be preserved, they must be
immediately placed so as to be protected
against contact with the hands.
A good holder that will display both
sides of a coin can be made of two
pieces of glass, BB, between which is
placed a cardboard cut as shown at A.
The cardboard should be about the
same thickness as the coins. The
glass may be framed by using strips
of wood rabbeted to receive the edges
of both pieces; or their edges may be
bound with passe-partout tape. Even
when a frame is used, it is best to bind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>[54]</a></span>

<h2>
A Homemade Direct-View Finder for Cameras
</h2>


<p>
Every hand camera and most of the
tripod cameras are equipped with finders
of one type or another, and usually
one in which the image of the field is
reflected upward on a small ground
glass&mdash;being, in fact, a miniature
camera obscura. The later and generally
more approved style of finder
has a small concave lens conveniently
set on the outer edge of the camera.
When this direct-vision type of finder
is used, the camera is held so that the
finder is at the height of the eye,
a condition that is particularly desirable.
When in a crowd, of course,
the professional and many amateurs
are familiar with the method of holding
the camera inverted over the head
and looking up into the finder to determine
the range of the field. Even
this method is inconvenient, often impractical.
</p>

<p>
The up-to-date newspaper photographer
insists on having his camera
equipped with direct finders, as it
saves him much trouble and many failures.
Anyone with a little ingenuity
can change one of the old-type finders
into a combination device, either direct
or indirect. The sketches are self-explanatory,
but it may be said that
Fig.&nbsp;1 represents a box camera with
a regulation finder set in one corner of
the box. To make it a direct finder, a
small brass hinge is used. Cut off part
of one wing, leaving a stub just long
enough to be attached to the front of
the camera directly above the lens of
the finder and so as not to interfere
with it, and high enough to permit the
other wing to be turned down on the
ground glass, with space allowed for
the thin glass mirror A, that is to be
glued to the under side of the long
wing. The joint of the hinge should
work quite stiffly in order to keep it
from jarring out of any position in
which it may be set.

of Converting Them into Direct-View Finders</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>[55]</a></span>
If the wing is turned upward at an
angle of 45&nbsp;deg., the finder can be used
as a direct-vision instrument when held
at the height of the eyes. The image
reflected from the small mirror is inverted,
but this is no disadvantage to
the photographer. The small pocket
mirror given out for advertising purposes
serves very well for making the
reflecting mirror.
</p>

<p>
The finder shown in Fig.&nbsp;2 is another
very common kind, and one that is
readily converted into the direct type
by inserting a close-fitting mirror, B,
on the inside of the shield to be used
as a reflector of the finder image. If
the mirror is too thick, it may interfere
with the closing of the shield,
though in many cases this is not essential,
but if it should be necessary
to close down the shield in order to
fold the camera, it can usually be readjusted
to accommodate the mirror.

Cut two slits in the belt, a distance
apart equal to the diameter of the cartridge.
Pass the narrow leather piece
through one slit and back through the
other, thus forming a loop on the belt
to receive a cartridge. About 1/4&nbsp;in.
from the first loop form another by
cutting two more slits and passing the
leather through them as described, and
so on, until the belt has loops along its
whole length.

of the bed and fastened to the frame
with wire, bolts, or wedges. Screwhooks,
about 1-1/4&nbsp;in. long, are turned
into the strip so that they will match

  <p>Operating the Electric Lamp Switch or Key by the

</div>

<p>
When the door is opened, the lamp is
lit, and when leaving the room the
opening of the door again turns it out.
The hook should be placed quite close
to the edge of the door, to reduce the
length of the movement, and even then
it is too much for the length of the pull
required to operate the switch, hence
the need of the rubber bands.
</p>

<p>
The lamp chain pulls out just 1&nbsp;in.,
and consequently the lamp is lit when
the door is opened part way; and
swinging the door farther only stretches
the rubber. This is an advantage,
however, because the lamp is sure to
light regardless of the swing of the
door. If no rubber were used, the door
would have to open just a certain distance
each time.
</p>

<p>
If the cord is connected to the hook
with a loop or a ring, it may be easily
disconnected during the day when not
needed. A light coil spring may be
used in place of the rubbers.&mdash;Contributed

Skating Merry-Go-Round<br />
By Henry Burich
</h2>


<p>
After once making and using the
ice merry-go-round as illustrated, no
pond will be complete unless it has one
or more of these devices.
To construct an amusement
device of this kind,
select a good pole that will
reach to the bottom of the
pond. The measurement
can be obtained by cutting
a hole in the ice at the desired
place and dropping
in a line weighted on one
end. A sufficient length of
the pole should be driven
into the bottom of the
pond to make it solid and
allow the upper end to project
above the surface of
the ice at least 4&nbsp;feet.
</p>

<p>
A turning crosspiece for
the upper end of the pole
is made as follows: First
prepare the end of the pole by sawing
it off level, then cutting off the bark
and making it round for a metal ring
which should be driven on tightly. A
pin, about 3/4&nbsp;in. in diameter, is then
driven into a hole bored in the end of
the pole. The crosspiece is made of 2 by
6-in. material, at least 18&nbsp;ft. long. A
hole is bored in the center to receive
the pin in the pole end.

  <p>The Extra Runner in Front is Pivoted, and When
Turned, Guides the Sled</p>
</div>

<p>
An ordinary hand sled can be easily
converted into a sled that can be
guided like a bobsled by the addition
of one extra runner. To attach this
runner, a piece of wood is fastened to
the under side and in the center at the
front end of the sled top. A runner
with a crosspiece on top is pivoted to
the extending wood piece, which
should be of a length to make the position
comfortable when the coaster,
sitting on the sled top, has his feet on
the ends of the crosspiece. Careful
measurements should be made to have
the lower edge of the runner on a level
with or a little lower than the sled runners.

The person using a cane pole for fishing
can easily provide a place for the
hooks and sinkers in the first large
joint of the pole. Cut the cane off just
above the first large joint, and it will
leave a space, 4 or 5&nbsp;in. long, which
can be used for the hooks and sinkers.
A cork is fitted in the end, to hold them
in place.&mdash;Contributed by Victor E.

Drying Small Laundered Articles
</h2>


<p>
Where mechanical drying is not in
use it takes considerable time to hang
out a number of handkerchiefs, laces,
collars, etc., and very often the wind
will blow away many of them. The
task of drying these articles is made
light by using a bag of mosquito netting
with the articles placed in it and
hung on a line. The air can pass
through the netting and when the
articles are dry it does not take long
to take them out.&mdash;Contributed by

<h2>
Decorative Wood Panels
</h2>


<p>
Procure an unplaned board that is
deeply scored by the teeth of the saw
and mark an outline of the desired figure
on its surface. Sandpaper the
background lightly, cut in a moon and
smooth down the tree trunks. The
background can be smoothed with a
sharp chisel, or large portions planed,
but in all cases leave the foliage rough.
</p>

<p>
Finish the surfaces with oils or
stains, applying colors to suit the parts;
a piece of dried red cedar, oiled, will
produce a warm red, and a green red
cedar, oiled, becomes soft yellow, each
producing a very pretty effect. These
panels offer unlimited opportunity for
originality in design and color finishing
of different woods.&mdash;Contributed by

<h2>
Fishing-Rod Making and Angling<br />
By Stillman Taylor
<br />
Part I&mdash;A One-Piece Casting Rod
</h2>


<p>
The pleasures of outdoor life are
most keenly enjoyed by those
sportsmen who are familiar with all the
little tricks&mdash;the "ins and outs"&mdash;of the
open. It is the active participation in
any chosen sport which makes the
sport well worth while, for the enjoyment
gleaned from little journeys to
forest and stream largely rests with
the outer's own knowledge of his sport.
Not all of the fun of fishing lies in the
catching of the fish, since the satisfaction
which comes through handling a
well-balanced rod and tackle must be
reckoned the chief contributor to the
outing. In other words, the pleasures
of fishing do not depend so much upon
the number of fish caught, as the manner
in which the person fishes for them.
The rod is naturally the first and important
consideration in the angler's
kit, and it is the purpose of these articles
to set forth, at first, a few hints
which my own long experience leads
me to think may be of some assistance
to those anglers who enjoy making and
repairing their own rods and tackle,
to be followed, later, by some suggestions
on the art of angling generally.
The hints given are merely my own
methods, and while they may not be
the best way of accomplishing the desired
end, a good fishing rod may be
constructed. Like the majority of amateurs,
I have achieved the desired results
with a few common tools, namely,
a saw, plane, jackknife, file, and sandpaper.
These simple tools are really
all that is needed to turn out a serviceable
and well-finished rod of excellent
action.
</p>
<h3>Kind of Material</h3>
<p>
The great elasticity and durability
of the split-cane or split-bamboo rod
cannot be easily disputed. The handmade
split bamboo is unquestionably
the best rod for every kind of fishing,
but it is also the most expensive and
the most difficult material for the amateur
to work. In making the first rod
or two, the beginner will be better satisfied
with the results in making a
good solid-wood rod. Of course,
glued-up split-bamboo butts, joints,
and tip stock may be purchased, and
if the angler is determined to have only
bamboo, it is advisable to purchase
these built-up sections rather than to
risk certain failure by attempting to
glue the cane. However, there are several
good woods particularly well
adapted for rod making, and while
slightly inferior to the finest bamboo
in elasticity and spring, the carefully
made solid-wood rod is good enough
for any angler and will probably suit
the average fisherman as well as any
rod that can be purchased.
</p>

<p>
Bethabara, or washaba, a native
wood of British Guinea, makes a fine
rod, but it is a heavy wood, very hard,
and for this reason is perhaps less desirable
than all other woods. With the
single exception of snakewood it is the
heaviest wood for rod making and is
only used for short bait-casting rods.
Possessing considerable strength Bethabara
can be worked quite slender, and
a 5-ft. casting tip can be safely made
of 5&nbsp;oz. weight.
</p>

<p>
Greenheart, a South American wood,
is popular alike with manufacturers
and amateur rod makers, and 90 per-cent
of the better class of solid-wood
rods are made of this material. It resembles
Bethabara in color, but is
lighter in weight, although it apparently
possesses about the same
strength and elasticity. In point of
fact, there is little, if any, choice between
these woods, and providing
sound and well-selected wood is used,
the merits of a rod made of Bethabara
or greenheart are more likely to be due
to the careful workmanship of the
maker than to the variety of the wood used.
</p>

<p>
Dagame, or dagama, a native of the
forests of Cuba, is in many respects the
ideal material for rod making, as it
has strength and elasticity. This
wood is straight-grained and free from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>[60]</a></span>
knots, which makes it easily worked;
it polishes well and is durable. While
there is always more or less difficulty
about procuring first-class Bethabara
and greenheart, dagame of good quality
is easily obtained.
</p>

<p>
Lancewood is much used in turning
out the cheaper grades of fishing rods,
but it is somewhat soft and has a
marked tendency to take set under the
strain of fishing and warp out of shape.
It is less expensive than the other
woods, and while it has a straight and
even grain, there are numerous small
knots present which make this material
less satisfactory to work than
the other woods. For heavy sea rods,
lancewood may serve the purpose fairly
well, but for the smaller fishing tools
this material is inferior to Bethabara,
greenheart, and dagame. Other woods
are often used, and while a good rod
may be frequently made from almost
any of them, the three mentioned are
held in the highest esteem by the
angling fraternity. For the first rod,
the amateur will make no mistake in
selecting dagame, whether the slender
fly rod or the more easily constructed
short bait-casting tool is to be made.
</p>
<h3>The Necessary Tools</h3>
<p>
The construction of a thoroughly
well-made and nicely balanced rod is
more a matter of careful work than
outfit, but a few suitable tools will
greatly facilitate the labor. A good
firm workbench, or table, 4&nbsp;ft. or more
in length, will be needed. A regulation
bench vise will come in handy, but one
of the small iron vises will do very
well. A couple of iron planes, one of
medium size for rough planing-up
work, and a small 4-in. block plane for
finishing, will be required. As the cutters
of the planes must be kept as sharp
as possible to do good work, a small
oilstone&mdash;preferably one in a wood
case with cover to keep out dust&mdash;will
be needed; a coarse single-cut mill file
about 16&nbsp;in. long; a few sheets of No.
1 and No. 0 sandpaper; a sheet or two
of fine emery cloth; a small thin "back"
or other saw, and a steel cabinet scraper.

  <p>Two Tools for Gauging the Diameter of the Rods,
and a Homemade Scraper (Fig.&nbsp;1, Fig.&nbsp;2, Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
A caliper of some kind is a necessity,
and while the best is a micrometer,
Fig.&nbsp;1, registering to a thousandth part
of an inch, as well as indicating 8ths,
16ths, 32ds, and 64ths, this tool is somewhat
expensive, but a very good caliper
may be had in the sliding-arm type,
Fig.&nbsp;2, with the scale graduated to 64ths
and taking work up to 2&nbsp;in. in diameter.
Cheaper measuring gauges are to be
had in plenty, but as the brass and
boxwood scales are provided only with
coarse graduations, the better quality
of mechanics' tools will give better satisfaction.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img060b'>
  <img src='images/img060b.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>(Fig.&nbsp;4)</p>
</div>

<p>
The set of grooved planes used by
the professional rod makers are rather
expensive, although they are most convenient
for quickly rounding up the rod
to the desired diameter. However, the
beginner may dispense with the planes
by making the tool illustrated in Fig.
3. To make this handy little tool purchase
a steel wood scraper, such as
cabinetmakers use, and file a series of
grooves along the edges with a round
file. File at right angles to the steel,
finishing up with a finer file to give a
sharp cutting
edge. The tool
thus made is
very handy for
scraping the rod
after it has been
roughly rounded
with the plane. Its use will be mentioned
later on in the description.
</p>
<h3>Five-Foot Bait-Casting Rod</h3>
<p>
The short one-piece bait-casting rod
with but one ferrule is the easiest rod
to make, and for this reason the beginner
will do well to select this popular
type for the first attempt. As the
total length of the rod is to measure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>[61]</a></span>
5&nbsp;ft., exclusive of the agate tip, the
wood should be 1 or 2&nbsp;in. longer to
allow for cutting down to 60&nbsp;inches.
</p>

<p>
Having selected a good strip of
dagame, 5/8&nbsp;in. square, run the plane
along each side and from both ends.
This will determine the direction in
which the grain runs. Drill two holes
at the end decided upon for the butt,
spacing them about 1/4&nbsp;in. from the
end, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. Drive a stout
brad in the corner of the bench top
and hook the butt end over the nail.
By rigging the stick up in this manner
it will be securely held, and planing
may be done with the grain with
greater ease and accuracy than when
the end of the stick is butted up against
a cleat nailed to the bench top.
</p>

<p>
The wood should be planed straight
and true from end to end and calipered
until it is 1/2&nbsp;in. square. It may appear
crooked, but this need not trouble
one at this stage of the work, since it
may be made perfectly straight later
on. Overlook any kinks, and do not
attempt to straighten the stick by
planing more from one side than the
other. The chief thing to be done is
to fashion a square stick, and when the
caliper shows the approximate diameter,
draw crosslines at the ends to find
the center.
</p>

<p>
The length of the hand grasp should
be marked out. If a double grasp is
wanted, allow 12&nbsp;in. from the butt end.
This will afford an 11-in. hand grasp
after sawing off the end in which the
holes were drilled. For a single hand
grasp make an allowance of 11&nbsp;in.
However, the double grasp&mdash;with cork
above and below the reel seat&mdash;is preferred
by most anglers because it affords
a better grip for the hand when
reeling in the line. Mark the hand-grasp
distance by running a knife mark
around the rod 12&nbsp;in. from the butt end.

  <p>Diagram or Layout for a One-Piece Bait-Casting
Rod, Showing Calipered Dimensions for Each Six Inches of Length. A Paper
Pattern of Any Rod may be Drawn Up, Providing the Amateur Rod Maker Has
a Rod to Use for a Pattern, or Possesses the Exact Diameter of the Rod at
Intervals of Six Inches along Its Length (Fig.&nbsp;5)</p>
</div>

<p>
Lay out a diagram showing the full
length of the rod by placing a strip of
paper&mdash;the unprinted back of a strip
of wall paper is just the thing&mdash;on the
bench and drawing two lines from the
diameter of the butt to that of the tip.
While the caliber of casting rods differs
somewhat, the dimensions given
will suit the average angler, and I
would advise the beginner to make
the rod to these measurements. For
the butt, draw a line, exactly 1/2&nbsp;in.
long, across the paper and from the
center of this line run a straight pencil
mark at right angles to the tip end, or
60&nbsp;in. distant, at which point another
crossline is drawn, exactly 1/8&nbsp;in. long,
to represent the diameter. Connect
the ends of these two crosslines to
make a long tapering form. Divide
this pattern into eight equal parts, beginning
at 12&nbsp;in. from the butt end,
marking a crossline at every 6&nbsp;in.
This layout is shown exaggerated in
Fig.&nbsp;5. If it is desired to copy a certain
rod, find the diameter at the several
6-in. stations with the caliper and
write them down at the corresponding
sections of the paper diagram. However,
if a splendid all-around casting
rod is desired, it is perfectly safe to
follow the dimensions given in Fig.&nbsp;5,
which show the manner of dividing
the paper pattern into the equal parts
and the final diameter of the rod at
each 6-in. station, or line.
</p>

<p>

  <p>Gauge Made of Sheet Brass Having Slots
Corresponding in Length and Width with the Caliper-Layout Measurements
(Fig.&nbsp;6)</p>
</div>

<p>
Procure a small strip of thin brass,
or zinc, and file nine slots on one edge
to correspond in diameter with the
width of the horizontal lines which indicate
the diameter of the rod on the
pattern. This piece is shown in Fig.
6. By making use of the pattern and
the brass gauge, the rod may be given
the desired taper and the work will
proceed more quickly than if the caliper
is alone relied upon to repeatedly
check up the work.
</p>

<p>
When a good layout of the work is
thus made, the next step is to carefully
plane the stick so that it will be evenly
tapered in the square. Plane with the
grain and from the butt toward the
tip end, and make frequent tests with
caliper and gauge, noting the diameter
every 6&nbsp;in. Mark all the thick spots
with a pencil, and plane lightly to reduce
the wood to the proper diameter.
Reduce the stick in this manner until
all sides have an even taper from the
butt to the tip. The stick should now
be perfectly square with a nice, even
taper. Test it by resting the tip end
on the floor and bending it from the
butt end. Note the arch it takes and
see if it resumes its original shape
when the pressure is released. If it
does, the elasticity of the material is
as it should be, but if it remains bent
or takes "set," the wood is very likely
to be imperfectly seasoned and the rod
should be hung up in a warm closet, or
near the kitchen stove, for a few weeks,
to season.
</p>

<p>
To facilitate the work of planing
the stick to shape, a length of pine
board with a groove in one edge will
be found handy. A 5-ft. length of the
ordinary tongue-and-groove board,
about 1&nbsp;in. thick, will be just the thing.
As the tip of the rod is smaller than
the butt, plane the groove in the board
to make it gradually shallower to correspond
to the taper of the rod. Nail
this board, with the groove uppermost,
to the edge of the workbench, and
place the rod in the groove with one of
the square corners up, which can be
easily taken off with the finely set
plane. Plane off the other three corners
in a like manner, transforming
the square stick into one of octagon
form. This part of the work should
be carefully done, and the stick frequently
calipered at each 6-in. mark,
to obtain the proper taper. It is important
to make each of the eight
sides as nearly uniform as the caliper
and eye can do it. Set the cutter of
the small plane very fine, lay the strip
in the groove and plane off the corner
the full length of the stick, then turn
another corner uppermost and plane
it off, and so on, until the stick is almost
round and tapering gradually
from the mark of the hand grasp to
the tip.
</p>

<p>
To make the rod perfectly round,
use the steel scraper in which the
grooves were filed and scrape the whole
rod to remove any flat or uneven spots,
and finish up by sandpapering it down
smooth.
</p>

<p>
The action of the rod differs with
the material used, and in trying out
the action, it is well to tie on the tip
and guides and affix the reel by a string
in order to try a few casts. If the
action seems about right, give the rod
a final smoothing down with No. 0
sandpaper.

  <p>The Four Different Types of Hand Grasps
Are a Wood Sleeve Bored to Fit the Butt of the Rod; the Built-Up Cork over
a Wood Sleeve; a Cane-Wound Grasp, and the Double Cord-Wound Grasps with
a Reel Seat between Them (Fig.&nbsp;7)</p>
</div>

<p>
For the hand grasp nothing is so
good as solid cork, and while hand
grasps may be purchased assembled,
it is a simple matter to make them. In
Fig.&nbsp;7 are shown four kinds of handles,
namely, a wood sleeve, or core,
A, bored to fit the butt of the rod and
shaped for winding the fishing cord;
a built-up cork grasp, B, made by cementing
cork washers over a wood
sleeve, or directly to the butt of the
rod; a cane-wound grip, C, mostly
used for salt-water fishing, and the
double-wound grip, D, made in one
piece, then sawed apart in the center,
the forward grip being glued in place
after the reel seat is in position.
</p>

<p>
To make a grip, select a number of
cork washers, which may be obtained
from dealers in the wholesale drug
trade, or from any large fishing-tackle
dealer. Make a tool for cutting a hole
in their centers from a piece of tubing,
or an old ferrule of the required diameter,
by filing one edge sharp, then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>[63]</a></span>
covering the other end with several thicknesses
of cloth. Turn this tube around
in the cork like a wad cutter. If the
cutter is sharp, a nice clean cut will
result, but the opposite will likely occur
if an attempt is made to hammer
the tube through the cork.
</p>

<p>
Having cut the butt end of the rod
off square, about 1&nbsp;in. from the end,
or enough to remove the holes, smear
a little hot glue on the end, drop a
cork washer over the tip of the rod and
work it down to the butt. Cut another
cork, give the first one a coat of glue,
slip the former over the tip and press
the two together, and so on, until about
10 corks have been glued together in
position. This will give a hand grasp
a trifle over 5&nbsp;in. long.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img063b'>
  <img src='images/img063b.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Corks Glued in Place on the Butt
and the Wood Sleeve, or Reel-Seat Core, Ready to Slide Down and Glue in
Position (Fig.&nbsp;8)</p>
</div>

<p>
A sleeve will be needed for the reel
seat to slip over, and a soft-wood core
of this sort can be purchased from any
dealer in rod-making materials, or it
can be made at home. For the material
procure a piece of white pine, about
3/4&nbsp;in. in diameter and 5&nbsp;in. long. A
section sawed from a discarded curtain
roller will serve the purpose well.
Bore a 15/32-in. hole through the piece
and plane down the outside until it
slips inside the reel seat. It should be
well made and a good fit, and one end
tapered to fit the taper of the reel seat,
while the opposite end should be about
1/4&nbsp;in. shorter than the reel seat. Slide
this wood sleeve down the rod, as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;8, coat the rod and the
upper part of the last cork with glue
and force the sleeve tightly in place.
A day or two should be allowed for
the glue to set and thoroughly dry, before
giving the hand grasp the final
touches.
</p>

<p>
If a lathe is at hand, the hand grasp
may be turned to any desired shape,
but most anglers prefer a cylindrical-shaped
grip, leaving the top cork untrimmed
to form a kind of shoulder
when the metal reel seat is pressed into
the cork. If corks of 1-1/4-in. diameter
are purchased, but little trimming will
be necessary to work the hand grasp
down to 1-1/16&nbsp;in. in diameter. This size
seems to fit the average hand about
right. The lower corks will need a
little trimming to fit the taper of the
butt cap so that it may fit snugly in
place. Cement the butt cap in place
by heating the cap moderately hot,
then rub a little of the melted ferrule
cement inside the cap, and force it over
the cork butt. When the cement has
hardened, drive a small brass pin or
brad through the cap, and file the ends
off flush with the metal surface. All
the guides, ferrules, and reel seat are
shown in Fig.&nbsp;9.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>[64]</a></span>
The regulation metal reel seat is
about 4-1/2&nbsp;in. long, and in fitting it to
the old type of bait rod, the covered
hood is affixed to the upper end of the
reel seat. This arrangement is satisfactory
enough for the 9-ft. bait rod, but it
is rather awkward in fitting it to the
short bait-casting rod, as with the hood
at the upper end the reel is pushed so
far forward that it leaves 1&nbsp;in. or more
of the reel seat exposed, and the hand
must grip this smooth metal instead
of the cork. To avoid this, it is best
to cut the reel seat down to 3-7/8&nbsp;in.
and affix the reel seat to the rod with
the hood at the lower end near the
hand. For a single hand grasp, a tapered
winding check will be needed to
make a neat finish and this should be
ordered of the correct diameter to fit
the reel seat at the lower end and the
diameter of the rod at the other. In
the double hand grasp the winding
check is used to finish off the upper
end of the cork, which is tapering to
fit the rod at this point.
</p>

<p>
In assembling the reel seat, push
it with the hooded end well down and
work it into the cork to make a tight
waterproof joint. Push the reel seat
up the rod, coat the sleeve with cement
and push the reel seat home. Drive
a small pin through the hooded end and
reel seat to make the whole rigid. This
pin should not be driven through the
rod or it will weaken it at this point.
Just let it enter the wood a short distance
to prevent the reel seat from turning.
</p>

<p>
The upper or double grasp is fashioned
after the reel seat is in position,
and the corks are cemented on and
pushed tightly together in the same
manner as used in forming the lower
grasp. The first cork should be pressed
tightly against the upper end of the
reel seat and turned about so that the
metal may enter the cork and form a
tight joint. As many corks as are required
to form a grip of proper length
are in turn cemented to each other and
the rod. After the glue has become
dry, the cork may be worked down and
tapered to make a smooth, swelled
grasp. The winding check is now cemented
on, to make a neat finish between
the upper grip and the rod.
</p>

<p>
Before affixing the guides, go over
the rod with fine sandpaper, then wet
the wood to raise the grain, and repeat
this operation, using old sandpaper. If
an extra-fine polish is wanted, rub it
down with powdered pumice and oil,
or rottenstone and oil, and finish off
with an oiled rag.
</p>

<p>
To fit the agate tip, file down the end
of the rod with a fine-cut file until it
is a good fit in the metal tube. Melt
a little of the ferrule cement and smear
a little on the tip of the rod, then push
the agate down in place.
</p>

<p>
Spar varnish is often used to protect
the rod, but extra-light coach varnish
gives a better gloss, and it is as durable
and waterproof as any varnish. It
is only necessary to purchase a quarter
pint of the varnish, as a very small
quantity is used. The final varnishing
is, of course, done after the rod has
been wound and the guides are permanently
whipped in position. However,
it is an excellent idea to fill the pores
of the wood by rubbing it over with a
cloth saturated in the varnish before
the silk whippings are put on. Merely
fill the cells of the wood and wipe off
all surplus, leaving the rod clean and
smooth.
</p>

<p>
The guides may now be fastened in
place, and for the 5-ft. rod, but two of
them are necessary. The first guide
should be placed 19-1/2&nbsp;in. from the
metal taper which finishes off the upper
hand grasp, and the second guide
spaced 15-1/2&nbsp;in. from the first. By spacing
the guides in this manner, the line
will run through them with the least
possible friction.
</p>
<h3>Winding, or Whipping, the Rod</h3>
<p>
Before whipping on the guides, take
a fine file and round off the sharp edges
of the base to prevent the possibility
of the silk being cut. Measure off the
required distances at which the guides
are to be affixed, and fasten them in
position by winding with a few turns
of common thread. Ordinary silk of
No. A size may be used, but No. 00 is
the best for small rods. Most anglers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>[65]</a></span>
agree that the size of the silk to use
for the whippings should be in proportion
to the size of the rod&mdash;heavy silk
for the heavy rod, and fine silk for the
small rod. Size A is the finest silk
commonly stocked in the stores, but
one or more spools of No. 00 and No.
0 may be ordered from any large dealer
in fishing tackle. As a rule, size 0
gives a more workmanlike finish to the
butt and joints of fly and bait rods,
while No. 00 is about right to use for
winding the tips. In fact, all rods
weighing up to 6&nbsp;oz. may be whipped
with No. 00 size.

  <p>The Mountings Used on a Bait-Casting Rod
Consist of a Reel Seat, Butt Cap, Taper Sleeve, Narrow Agate Guide, Agate
Offset Top, One Ring Guide, and a Welted, Shouldered Ferrule (Fig.&nbsp;9)</p>
</div>

<p>
In whipping the rod, the so-called
invisible knot is used. Begin the whipping,
as shown at E, Fig.&nbsp;10, by tucking
the end under the first coil and
holding it with the left thumb. The
spool of silk is held in the right hand
and the rod is turned to the left, sufficient
tension being kept on the silk so
that it can be evenly coiled with each
strand tightly against the other. A
loop of silk, some 4&nbsp;in. long, is well
waxed and placed so that its end will
project a short distance beyond the last
coil which finishes the whipping. This
detail is shown at F. In whipping on
guides, begin the whipping at the base
and work over the pointed end of the
flange, winding on sufficient silk to extend
about 1/8&nbsp;in. beyond the pointed
flange of the guide base. When the
last coil is made, cut off the thread
from the spool and tuck the end under
the whipping by pulling on the ends
of the waxed loop, as shown at G.
Cut off the ends neatly with a sharp
knife.

  alt=''
  />
  <p>Both Ends of the Silk Thread are Placed
under the Winding to Form an Invisible Knot (Fig.&nbsp;10)</p>
</div>

<p>
For colors, bright red and a medium
shade of apple green are the best,
since these colors keep their original
tint after varnishing, and are less likely
to fade than the more delicate shades.
Red finished off with a narrow circle
of green always looks well, and red
with yellow is likewise a good combination.
Narrow windings look much better
than wide whippings, and a dozen
turns make about as wide a winding
as the angler desires. For edgings,
three or four turns of silk are about
right, and these should be put on after
the wider windings have been whipped
on and in the same manner, although it
is best to tuck the ends of the edging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>[66]</a></span>
beneath the wider winding when pulling
the end through to make the invisible knot.
</p>
<h3>Varnishing the Rod</h3>
<p>
After winding the rod, see that all
fuzzy ends are neatly clipped off, then
go over the silk windings with a coat
of shellac. The shellac can be made
by dissolving a little white shellac in
grain alcohol. Warm the shellac and
apply it with a small camel's-hair
brush, giving the silk only two light
coats. Allow the rod to stand a couple
of days for the shellac to become thoroughly dry.
</p>

<p>
A small camel's-hair brush will be
required for the varnishing&mdash;one about
1/2&nbsp;in. wide will do. If the varnishing
is to be done out of doors, a clear and
warm day should be selected, and the
can of coach varnish should be placed
in a pot of hot water for five minutes,
so that the varnish will spread evenly.
A temperature of about 75&nbsp;deg. is best
for this work, as the varnish will not
spread if cold or in a cold place. The
varnish should be evenly brushed on,
and care taken that no spots are left
untouched. Hang up by the tip to dry
in a room free from dust. While the
varnish will set in four or five hours,
it is a good plan to allow three days
for drying between coats. Two coats
will suffice to protect the rod, but as
coach varnish, properly applied, is
rather thin in body, three coats will
give complete protection to the wood.
</p>

<p>
The materials required for this rod are,
</p>


<ul class='lsoff'>
<li>
1 dagame or greenheart stick, 5&nbsp;ft.

Automatic Watering System for Poultry Yards
</h2>


<p>
Where a large number of poultry is
cared for, the annoyance and attention
necessary to furnish a constant water
supply can be overcome by using the
system shown in the illustration. For
this purpose a storage tank must be
provided. This may be some old toilet
flush tank, or any open reservoir that
will hold sufficient water to keep all
the drinking pans supplied. A float is
provided and connected with a stop
valve, so that when the float drops
below a certain level, the valve will
be turned open, and a fresh supply of
water will enter the storage tank,
thereby again raising the float and closing
the valve.

Each drinking pan should be about
10&nbsp;in. in diameter by 4&nbsp;in. deep, and
is drilled for a 7/8-in. hole to fit a 1/2-in.
pipe. At the pan end, the pipe is
threaded so that a lock nut and leather
washer can be attached on each side
of the pan bottom, to provide a watertight
joint; at the other end, the pipe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>[67]</a></span>
is screwed into a tee in the 1/2-in. main
line which connects with the storage tank.
</p>

<p>
In using the system, sufficient water
is run into the tank to fill the pans
about three-quarters full. The float
may then be adjusted to a shut-off position
for the inlet valve. All pans are
automatically kept at one level, even
though several may be used considerably
more than others. When the
general water level has dropped sufficiently,
the float, dropping with it, will
open the stop valve, and cause the
water to enter the tank and pans until
the original level is again restored.&mdash;Contributed

Candles can be easily fitted with
attachments to extinguish the light at
a set time. To determine the length
of time, it is necessary to mark a
candle of the size used and time how long a
certain length of it will burn. Then it is sufficient
to suspend a small metal dome, or cap, to
which a string is attached, directly
over the flame, and run the opposite
end of the string over nails or
through screw eyes, so that it can be
tied around the candle such a distance
from the flame end, that the part between
the flame and the string will be
consumed in the time desired for the
light to burn. When this point is
reached, the string slips off the candle,
and the cap drops on the flame.

bend one end of it into a loop large
enough to fit around the rudder pin
after the latter is inserted in the eyelet.
Insert screws at A, B and C, letting
them project about 1/2&nbsp;in. from the
surface. Bend the rod at D and A in
the shape shown, and with a little adjustment
it will easily snap into position.
It will prevent the rudder from
riding up out of the eyelets, but can
be detached instantly. The device

In trimming small photograph prints
I experienced some difficulty in getting

a perfect rectangle. In the place of a
trimming board I now use a piece of
glass cut a little smaller than the desired
print. The edges of the glass are
smoothed by filing or grinding them.
In making a glass, be sure to have the
corners cut at perfect right angles and
the edges ground straight.

  <p>The Making of a Rod Not Only Affords Much
Pleasure, but the Rod can be Constructed as Desired</p>
</div>

<h2>
Fishing-Rod Making and Angling<br />
By Stillman Taylor
</h2>
<h3>Part II&mdash;Various Two and Three-Piece Rods</h3>

<p>
While the action of the one-piece
rod is undeniably better than
when the rod is made in two or three
pieces, it is less compact to carry. To
make a 5-ft. two-piece bait-casting rod,
the same dimensions as given for the
one-piece rod will make a very fine
fishing tool. It is well to make two
tips in view of a possible breakage.
The rod may consist of two pieces of equal
length, but a rod of better action is secured
by making the butt section somewhat
shorter with a relatively longer tip. By making
the butt section about 23&nbsp;in. long, exclusive
of ferrule and butt cap, and the
tip section 32-1/2&nbsp;in. long, a splendid little
rod is obtained which will fit any
of the regulation rod cases of 35-in. length. To make
a 6-1/2-oz. rod of this kind with a cork hand grasp,
caliper it in the same manner as the
one-piece rod, making the butt section
32-1/2&nbsp;in. long, tapering from 15/32&nbsp;in. at
the upper end of the hand grasp to 19/64&nbsp;in. at the ferrule. The tip is made 33&nbsp;in.
long, tapering from 17/64&nbsp;in. to 7/64&nbsp;in.
By making the tip and butt to these
lengths, both parts will be of equal
length when the ferrules and the tops
are added. The material list is as follows,
the attachments being made of
german silver:
</p>


<ul class='lsoff'>
<li>
Dagame or greenheart
butt, 5/8&nbsp;in. by 3&nbsp;ft. long;
</li>

<li>
two tips 3/8&nbsp;in.
by 3&nbsp;ft. long;
</li>

<li>
one 3/4-in. reel seat with
straight hood;
</li>

<li>
one 1-in. butt cap;
</li>

<li>
one
taper, 15/32&nbsp;in. at the small end;
</li>

<li>
two
3/32-in. offset agate tops;
</li>

<li>
two 1/2-in. narrow
agate guides;
</li>

<li>
two No. 1 size one-ring casting
guides;
</li>

<li>
one 17/64-in. welted and shouldered ferrule,
with two closed-end centers, one for each tip;
</li>

<li>
two dozen cork washers, 1-1/4&nbsp;in. in diameter,
</li>

<li>
and two spools of winding silk.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The three-piece rod should be made up to 6&nbsp;ft. in
length to secure the best action,
but even if so made, the use of
the extra ferrules makes the rod less
resilient and elastic than the rod of
one or two-piece construction. The
best action is obtained only when the
rod bends to a uniform curve, and since
the ferrules cannot conform to this
curve, or arc, the more joints incorporated
in a rod, the less satisfactory it
will be from an angling standpoint.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>[70]</a></span>
Convenience in packing and carrying
are the sole merits which the many-jointed
rod possesses. Complete specifications
for making a three-piece bait-casting
rod, together with a material
list, is as follows: A rod, about 5-1/2&nbsp;ft.
long with a single or double hand grasp
made of cork, will weigh about 7&nbsp;oz.
Caliper the butt so that it will taper
from 15/32&nbsp;in to 11/32&nbsp;in at the cap of the
ferrule, making it 21-1/2&nbsp;in. long. The
middle joint is tapered from 21/64&nbsp;in. to
15/64&nbsp;in., and is 21-3/4&nbsp;in. long. The tips
are 21&nbsp;in. long and are tapered from
13/64&nbsp;in. to 7/64&nbsp;in. Dagame or greenheart
is used for the butt, joint, and
tips, and german silver for the fittings.
All pieces are 2&nbsp;ft. long, the butt is 5/8&nbsp;in., the joint and tips, 3/8&nbsp;in.

<h3>Fly Rods for Trout and Bass</h3>
<p>
Having made a good bait-casting
rod, the amateur will find little trouble
in making a rod with a number of
joints, and no special instructions need
be given, since the work of planing and
smoothing up the wood, and finishing
and mounting the rod, is the same as
has been described in detail before.
For fly fishing for trout, accuracy and
delicacy are of more importance than
length of cast, and the rod best suited
to this phase of angling differs greatly
from that used in bait casting. A stiff,
heavy rod is entirely unsuited for fly
casting, and while it is, of course, possible
to make a rod too willowy for the
sport, the amateur, working by rule of
thumb, is more likely to err on the
other side and make the fly rods of too
stout a caliber. The idea is simply to
help the amateur over the hard part
by giving a list of dimensions of a representative
trout and a bass fly rod.
To make a 9-ft. trout fly rod, with a
cork grasp having a length of 9&nbsp;in.
above the reel seat, caliper the material
as follows: The butt is tapered from
</p>


<ul class='lsoff'>

<li>
7/16&nbsp;in. to 25/64&nbsp;in. at 1&nbsp;ft. from the butt
end;

<li>
1-1/2&nbsp;ft., 11/32&nbsp;in.;
</li>

<li>
2&nbsp;ft, 21/64&nbsp;in.;
</li>

<li>
2-1/2&nbsp;ft., 5/16&nbsp;in., and 3&nbsp;ft., 19/64&nbsp;in.
</li>

<li>
The first 6&nbsp;in. of the middle joint is calipered to
9/32&nbsp;in.;
</li>

<li>
1&nbsp;ft, 17/64&nbsp;in.;
</li>

<li>
1-1/2&nbsp;ft, 15/64&nbsp;in.;
</li>

<li>
2&nbsp;ft., 7/32&nbsp;in.;
</li>

<li>
2-1/2&nbsp;ft, 13/64&nbsp;in., and
</li>

<li>
3&nbsp;ft., 3/16&nbsp;in.
</li>

<li>
The first 6&nbsp;in. of the tips are
calipered to 11/64&nbsp;in.;
</li>

</div>
<h3>The Independent-Butt Rod</h3>
<p>
The independent-butt rod, in which
the hand grasp contains the ferrule and
the tip is made in one piece, is a favorite
type with many of the best fishermen.
This mode of construction may
be used with all classes of rods, the
light fly and bait-casting rods, and the
heavier caliber rods used in salt-water
angling. In rods of this type, it is only
necessary to use the same size ferrule
to make as many tips as desired to fit
the one butt. Tips of several calibers
and weights may thus be fashioned to
fit the one butt, and if the single-piece
tip is too long for some special use, one
tip may be made a jointed one for ease
in carrying.
</p>

<p>
The independent butt, or hand grasp,
is made by fitting the ferrule directly
on a length of dagame, or greenheart,
which has been rounded so that the
seated ferrule will not touch the wood.
The ferrule is then cemented and riveted
in place, and a soft-pine sleeve
is fitted over the wood core and the
ferrule. The forward end of the sleeve
is, of course, tapered to fit the taper
of the reel seat, and when properly
fitted, its lower end will project about
1/4&nbsp;in. beyond the pine sleeve. Glue
the sleeve on this wood core, cement
the reel seat to the sleeve, and rivet the
reel seat in place.
</p>

<p>
The cork washers are glued in position,
working the first one into the
metal edge of the reel seat, to make a
nice, tight joint at this point. The
other corks are then glued in place
until the hand grasp is of the desired
length. The projecting end of the
wood core is then cut off flush with
the last cork, and the rod is mounted
in the usual manner.
</p>

<p>
In making a double hand grasp, the
forward grasp may be fitted over the
wood core in the fashion already described
in making the hand grasp for
the one-piece bait-casting rod, or the
forward grasp may be fitted to the tip,
just above the ferrule, as preferred.
Both methods are commonly used, the
only difference being in the manner of
finishing up the forward grasp. If the
forward grip is affixed to the ferruled
end of the tip, two tapered thimbles
will be required to make a nice finish.
</p>

<p>
The heavy-surf, or tarpon, rod is
made up of an independent, detachable
butt, 20&nbsp;in. long, having a solid-cork or
cord-wound hand grasp, and a one-piece
tip, 5-1/2&nbsp;ft. long, altogether weighing
23-1/2&nbsp;oz. It is uniformly calipered
to taper from 29/32&nbsp;in to 5/16&nbsp;in. One
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>[72]</a></span>
piece of dagame, or greenheart, 1&nbsp;in.
by 6-1/2&nbsp;ft., will be required.
</p>


<ul class='lsoff'>
<li>
One 1-in.
reel seat for detachable butt, including
one 3/4-in. male ferrule;
</li>

<li>
one 1-1/8-in. butt
cap; two No. 11 wide, raised agate
guides;
</li>

<li>
two No. 1 trumpet guides;
</li>

<li>
one
3/8-in. agate stirrup top;
</li>

<li>
two spools of
winding silk, A-size, and
</li>

<li>
two dozen
cork washers, or sufficient fishline to
cord the butt.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The guides are whipped
on double, the first set spaced 10&nbsp;in.
from the top, and the second, 26&nbsp;in.
from the reel. The core of the independent,
or detachable, butt is constructed
of the same material as the
rod, which makes the hand grasp somewhat
elastic and very much superior
to a stiff and rigid butt.

<h2>
Homemade Ball Catch for Cabinet Doors
</h2>


<p>
To make a ball catch, procure a piece
of brass, 1&nbsp;in. long, 1/2&nbsp;in. wide, and
about 1/16&nbsp;in. thick, and an old gas
burner having
a diameter of
3/8&nbsp;in. As described
by
Work, London,
the threaded
part of the burner
is cut off,
which forms a contracted end that will
hold a steel ball 5/16&nbsp;in. in diameter and
allow it to project 1/8&nbsp;in. A hole is
drilled in the center of the brass plate,
and the barrel soldered in place. A
piece of spiral spring is inserted behind
the ball. The stiffness of the
spring will depend on the use of the
catch. The barrel is cut to length and
plugged. Another plate of brass is
fitted with screw holes and a hole in
the center to receive the projecting ball
part, for the strike.

Combination Needle and Thread Tray

<p>
When any attempt is made to keep
sewing material, such as needles,
spools, or buttons, separate, each of the
articles is usually
kept in some
special drawer,
or by itself, and
when necessary
to use one, the
others must be
found, frequently
necessitating
many extra steps or much lost time in
hunting up the various articles. The
illustrated combination tray avoids this
difficulty. It consists of two round
trays fastened together near one edge
with a wood screw, which is loosely
fitted in the lower tray but screwed
into the upper to permit them being
swung apart. Extra thickness and
weight should be given the bottom
piece so no tipping will result when the
top is swung out to expose the buttons
in the lower section. The thread spools
are placed on pegs set in the upper
tray, and the cushion in the center is
provided for the pins and needles.&mdash;Contributed

Repairing Worn Escapement Wheel of a Clock
</h2>


<p>
When the ordinary clock has served
its usefulness and is apparently worn
out, the jeweler's price to overhaul it
frequently amounts to almost as much
as the original purchase price. One
weak place in the clock is the escapement
wheel. The points soon wear
down, thereby producing a greater escapement
and pendulum movement,
resulting in an increased strain and
wear of the clock. If the tips of the
teeth on the wheel are bent up slightly
with a pair of pliers, the swing of the
pendulum will be reduced, thereby increasing
the life of the clock. Many of
the grandfather's clocks can be put in
order in this manner so as to serve as a
timepiece as well as a cherished ornament.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Fishing-Rod Making and Angling<br />
By Stillman Taylor
</h2>
<h3>Part III&mdash;Trout Fishing with Fly and Bait</h3>
<p>The art of angling
is generally
viewed as
one of the world's
greatest recreations,
and while
each and every
phase of fishing
may be said to
possess certain
charms of its own,
fly fishing for
trout is regarded
by most well-informed sportsmen as
the alpha and omega of the angler's art.
This is so because the trout family are
uncommonly wary and game fish, and
the tackle used for their capture is of
finer balance and less clumsy than any
employed in angling for the coarser
game fishes. If he would take full advantage
of any sport and reap the
greatest pleasure from a day spent in
the open, it is really necessary for the
sportsman to get together a good outfit.
It is not essential to have a very
expensive one, but it should be good of
its kind, well proportioned for the purpose
for which it is to be used. The beginner,
who buys without good knowledge
of the articles
required, or fails to
use careful discrimination,
is almost certain to accumulate
a varied assortment of
junk, attractive enough in appearance,
perhaps, but well-nigh
useless when it is tested out on
the stream. A good representative outfit,
then, is of the first importance; it
means making a good beginning by initiating
the novice in the sport under
the most favorable conditions. Let us
then consider the selection of a good
fishing kit, a well-balanced rod, the
kind of a reel to use with it, the right
sort of a line, flies, and the other few
items found in the kit of the practical
and experienced trout fisherman.
</p>
<h3>Selecting a Good Fly Rod</h3>
<p>
The ordinary fishing pole may be
bought offhand at almost any hardware
store, but a well-balanced rod for
fly fishing should be well tested out
beforehand. The requirements call for
a rod of comparatively light weight,
a rod that is elastic and resilient, and
yet strong enough to prove durable
under the continued strain of much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>[74]</a></span>
fishing. If the angler has made his
own rod, as suggested in former chapters,
he will have a good dependable
fly rod, but the large majority of anglers
who are about to purchase their
first fishing kit should carefully consider
the selection of the rod. At the
outset it must be understood that good
tackle is simply a matter of price, the
finest rods and reels are necessarily
high in price, and the same thing may
be said of lines and flies. Providing
the angler has no objection to paying
$15, or more, for a rod, the choice will
naturally fall upon the handmade split
bamboo. For this amount of money a
fair quality fly rod may be purchased,
the finer split bamboos costing anywhere
up to $50, but under $15 it is
very doubtful whether the angler can
procure a built-up rod that is in every
way satisfactory. The question may
arise, Is a split-bamboo rod necessary?
The writer's own long experience says
that it is not, and that a finely made
solid-wood rod, of greenheart or dagame,
is quite as satisfactory in the
hands of the average angler as the
most expensive split bamboo. A good
rod of this sort may be had for $10,
and with reasonable care ought to last
a lifetime.
</p>

<p>
The points to look for in a fly rod,
whether the material is split bamboo
or solid wood, is an even taper from the
butt to the tip; that is, the rod should
register a uniform curve, or arc, the
entire length. For general fly casting
9&nbsp;ft. is a handy length, and a rod of
6-1/2&nbsp;oz. weight will prove more durable
than a lighter tool. A good elastic
rod is wanted for fly casting, but a too
willowy or whippy action had best be
avoided. However, for small-brook
fishing, where the overgrown banks
prohibit long casts, a somewhat
shorter and stiffer rod will be more
useful. For casting in large northern
streams, where the current is swift
and the trout run to a larger size, a
9-1/2 or 10-ft. rod of 8&nbsp;oz. weight is often
preferred. Of course, the veteran angler
can safely use a much lighter rod
than the beginner, and one occasionally
meets a man on the stream that
uses a 5-oz. rod for pretty heavy fishing.
To be on the safe side, the novice
will make no mistake in choosing a
rod of fair length and conservative weight.
</p>

<p>
When selecting a rod in the tackle
shop, do not rest content with a mere
examination of the appearance, but
have the dealer affix a reel of the
weight and size intended to be used
with it. By reeling on a short length
of line and reeving it through the
guides and then fastening the end to a
weight lying upon the floor, a very
good idea of the rod's behavior may be
gained, since by reeling in the line and
putting tension on the rod its elasticity
and curve may be seen and felt as well
as in actual fishing. To give the utmost
satisfaction, the rod should fit its
owner, and several rods should be
tried until one is found that most fully
meets the angler's idea of what a rod
should be. If one happens to have a
good fly reel, by all means take it
along and attach it to the rod while
making the tests. It is practically impossible
to gauge the balance of a rod
without affixing the reel, and many a
finely balanced tool will appear badly
balanced until the proper-weight reel
is affixed to it.
</p>
<h3>The Proper Kind of Reel</h3>
<p>
For fly fishing nothing is so good as
the English style of click reel, which
is made with a one-piece revolving
side plate and with the handle affixed
directly to it. Any kind of a balanced-handle
reel is an out-and-out nuisance
on the fly rod, because it has no advantage
in quickly recovering the line, and
the projecting handle is forever catching
the line while casting. In fly casting,
the length of cast is regulated by
the amount of line taken from the reel
before the cast is made, and it is while
"pumping" this slack line through the
guides, in making the actual cast, that
the balanced or projecting handle is
very apt to foul the line. A good reel
that is smooth-running like a watch
will cost about $10, but a very good
one may be had for $5, and cheaper
ones, while not so durable, may be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>[75]</a></span>
used with fair satisfaction. The heavier
multiplying reels, so essential for bait
casting from a free reel, are altogether
unsuited for the fly rod, being too
heavy when placed below the hand,
which is the only proper position for
the reel when fly casting. The single-action
click reel, having a comparatively
large diameter, but being quite
narrow between the plates, is the one
to use, and hard rubber, or vulcanite,
is a good material for the side plates,
while the trimmings may be of german
silver or aluminum. The all-metal
reel is of about equal merit, but
whatever the material, the most useful
size is one holding about 40 yd. of
No. E size waterproof line. A reel of
this capacity will measure about 3&nbsp;in.
in diameter and have a width of about
7/8&nbsp;in. between plates. A narrow-spooled
reel of this type enables the
fisherman to reel in the line plenty fast
enough. Owing to the fact that the
reel is placed below the grip on fly
rods, a rather light-weight instrument
is needed to balance the rod. Of the
two extremes, it is better to err on the
side of lightness, because a heavy reel
makes a butt-heavy rod and, throwing
extra weight on the wrist and arm,
makes casting increasingly difficult
after an hour's fishing. An old hand
at the game will appreciate this point
better than the novice.

<h3>The Kind of Line to Use</h3>
<p>
The fly-casting line used by a veteran
is generally of silk, enameled and
having a double taper; that is, the line
is thickest in the center and gradually
tapers to a smaller diameter at each
end. Single-tapered lines are likewise
extensively used, and while they cost
less, they are tapered at one end only
and cannot be reversed to equalize the
wear caused by casting. The level
line, which has the same diameter
throughout its entire length, is the
line most generally used, but the cast
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>[76]</a></span>
cannot be so delicately made with it.
For the beginner, however, the level
line in size No. E is a good choice. For
small-brook fishing, No. F is plenty
large enough. In choosing the size of
line, there is a common-sense rule
among fly casters to select a line proportioned
to the weight of the rod.
For a light rod a light line is the rule,
and for the heavier rod a stouter line
is the logical choice. If the rod is of a
too stiff action, use a comparatively
heavy line, and it will limber up considerably;
if the rod is extremely
"whippy," use the lightest line that can
be purchased, and used with safety.
</p>
<h3>A Fine Leader Marks the Expert Caster</h3>
<p>
The leader for trout is preferably of
single gut, and as fine as the angler's
skill will allow. The fly caster's rule
is to use a leader whose breaking strain
is less than the line, then, when the
tackle parts, it is simply a question of
putting on a new leader and the more
expensive line is saved. Ready-made
leaders may be purchased, or the angler
can tie them up as desired. For
length, a 3 or 3-1/2-ft. leader is about
right for average fishing. Longer
leaders are used, and while they sometimes
are of advantage, the 3-ft. length
is more useful. A longer leader is awkward
to handle because the loop is apt
to catch in the top of the rod when
reeling in the line to bring the fish close
to the landing net. Leaders may be
had with a loop at each end, or with
loops tied in, for using a cast of two
or three flies. For all average casting,
the two-fly cast is the best, but the
expert angler uses the single-fly very
often. For lake fishing, the single large
fly is generally preferred. For using
two flies, the leader is provided with
three loops, one at the top, another at
the bottom, and an extra loop tied in
about 15&nbsp;in. from the lower loop. In
fly casting, the first, or upper, fly is
known as the "dropper," and the lower
one as the "tail" fly. For the single-fly
cast but two loops are required.
</p>

<p>
Gut used for leaders should be carefully
selected, and only those lengths
which are of uniform diameter and
well rounded chosen, the lengths which
show flat and rough spots being discarded.
Dry gut that is very brittle
should be handled very little, and previous
to a day's fishing the leaders
must be soaked in water over night to
make them pliable, then coiled in between
felt pads of the leader box to
keep them in fishing shape. After use,
put the frayed leaders aside and dry
them out between the flannel leaves of
the fly book.
</p>

<p>
Gut is the product of the silkworm,
and the best quality is imported from
Spain. It comes in bundles, or hanks,
of 1,000 strands, 10 to 20&nbsp;in. long and
in different thicknesses, or strengths.
The heaviest are known as "Royal"
and "Imperial," for salmon; "Marana,"
for extra-heavy bass; "Padron," for
bass; "Regular," for heavy trout;
"Fina," for light trout, and "Refina,"
for extra-light trout. The grades
"Fina" and "Refina" are well suited
for all average fly fishing, while the
heavier sizes are useful for heavy large
fishing.
</p>

<p>
To make the leaders, soak the
strands of gut in warm water over
night until they are soft and pliable.
Select the strands for each leader of
the desired thickness and length so
that the finished leader will have a
slight taper to one end only. By using
the "Fina" gut for the upper length
and tying in two lengths of "Refina"
gut, a nicely tapered leader of light
weight is obtained. Begin the leader
by uniting the strands together to
make it the correct length, three 12-in.
strands being about right for average
casting. The "single water knot" is
the strongest and neatest to use.
Make it by taking the thick end of the
strand and doubling it back enough
to tie in a common knot just large
enough for the line to pass through
and drawing it up tightly. Tie a single
loose knot in the other end of the
strand, about 1/8&nbsp;in. in diameter and
close to the end; take the next thickest
strand of gut, thread the thicker
end through the loose knot and tie a
second square knot around the strand,
as shown at A. By pulling on the two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>[77]</a></span>
long ends the loops can be drawn up
tightly, and the two knots will slide
together and make a neat and very
strong knot. Repeat this operation
until as many strands of gut are knotted
together as required to make the
leader of the desired length. For making
the loop at the ends, a double-bighted
knot, tied as shown at B, is
used. If a dropper fly is desired, do
not pull the water knot tightly, but
first insert a short length of gut with a
common knot at the end and a loop in
the other, then draw the water knot
up tightly, and a short snell will be
made for attaching the fly as usually.

<h3>Flies for Trout Fishing</h3>
<p>
The standard selection of artificial
flies numbers about 60, but the average
fisherman will find about 24 selected
patterns to answer every need.
For making up the most "killing" flies
for the trout season, the following can
be recommended: Use red ibis, stone
fly, cinnamon, red spinner, and parchmenee
belle, for April; turkey brown,
yellow dun, iron blue, spinner, montreal
and red fox, for May; spider,
black gnat, silver doctor, gray drake,
orange dun, and green drake, for June;
July dun, grizzly king, pale evening
dun, red ant, and brown palmer, for
July; Seth green, coachman, shad,
governor, August dun, and royal
coachman, for August, and black
palmer, willow, whirling dun, queen of
the water, and blue bottle, for September.
</p>

<p>
To attach a line to the leader the
well-known "angler's knot" is mostly
used. This knot is shown at C. The
snelled fly is attached by passing the
loop over the loop of the leader and
inserting the fly through the leader
loop. When eyed flies are used they
are often attached direct to the leader,
or a looped snell may be used as in the
ordinary American-tied fly. To attach
the eyed fly direct to the leader, the
common "jam knot," shown at D, is
mostly used, and when the slipknot is
drawn up tightly and the extra end cut
off it makes a small, neat knot, not
apt to slip.

<h2>
Fishing-Rod Making and Angling<br />
By Stillman Taylor
</h2>
<h3>Part IV&mdash;Trout Fishing with Fly and Bait</h3>

<h3>How to Cast the Fly</h3>
<p>
To be able to cast the artificial fly
a distance of 50&nbsp;ft., or more, and
let the feathered lure alight upon the
desired bit of water as lightly as a falling
leaf is no small accomplishment,
for fly casting is an art, and to become
an expert, much practice is necessary.
The personal assistance of a skillful
caster is not often available, but if the
angler will follow the suggestions outlined,
a beginner will soon grasp the
knack of handling the fly rod, and the
casting will steadily improve with
practice. As the knack of handling a
gun is best gained&mdash;not in the field,
shooting live game, but through shooting
at targets&mdash;so may the art of fly
casting be more quickly acquired by
intelligent practice conducted away
from the stream, in the back yard, or
any other place roomy enough to swing
the rod and a moderately long line. By
practicing in this way, the angler's attention
is focused upon the cast and is
not partly occupied with the excitement
of fishing. To make a good beginning,
let the reel contain about 25
yd. of common, braided, linen line (size
E is about right) and instead of a fly,
or hook, affix a small split shot to the
end of the line. It is well to begin with
a cheap rod and save a good outfit,
and if the angler learns how to make
a fairly long and accurate cast with a
common rod, he may feel assured that
he can even do better with a first-rate outfit.
</p>

<div class='imgfr' style='width:300px;' id='img079b'>
  <img src='images/img079b.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Fig.&nbsp;1&mdash;The
Proper Way
to Take Hold
of the Handle
with the Reel on
the Under Side</p>
</div>

<p>
The first point to observe in making
the cast is to grip the rod correctly,
and this is done by grasping the rod
at the right point where it balances
best. By shifting the hand about
this point of balance is quickly
found, for at no other point will
the rod "hang" well in the hand.
In casting, the reel is turned to
the under side of the rod with
the thumb extended along the
top of the grip, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;1. Taking up an easy
casting position, with
the left foot slightly
advanced, pull
from the reel
about 25 yd. of line and let this slack
line fall in coils upon the ground in
front; bring the rod up slightly above
the horizontal, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2, and
with a quick snap of the wrist, avoiding
shoulder or body movement, throw
the tip upward, checking it sharply as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>[80]</a></span>
soon as the tip is carried over the shoulder
about 25&deg; beyond the vertical plane
as in Fig.&nbsp;3. This snappy upstroke of
the rod makes the "back cast," by projecting
the line high in the air, and
carries it well behind the angler. Before
the line has fully straightened out
behind, and before it has an opportunity
to fall much below the caster's
shoulders, the rod is snapped forward
with a quick wrist-and-forearm movement,
which throws the line forward in
front of the fisherman and in the direction
he is facing, which finishes the
cast with the rod
in the position
shown in Fig.&nbsp;4.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img080'>
  <img src='images/img080.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Fig.&nbsp;2&mdash;Begin the Cast with the Rod in a Position
Just above the Horizontal Plane</p>
</div>

<p>
Long and accurate
fly casting is
much more a matter
of skill than
muscle, and while
some fly fishermen
cast directly from
the shoulder and
upper arm, and
thus use a considerable
amount of
muscular force in
making the cast,
this cannot be regarded
as the best
method of casting.
The great elasticity
of the fly rod
ought to be taken
full advantage of
by the caster, and
if this is done,
casting will be
naturally accomplished
by the wrist and forearm. To
make strenuous efforts to hurl the fly
through the air, using an arm or body
movement, is extremely tiring after an
hour or so of fishing, while if the cast
is made from the wrist, aided by the
forearm, the snap of the rod may be
depended upon to project the fly to
greater length of line and allow it to
fall close to the desired spot, lightly
and without splashing.
</p>

<p>
Timing the back cast is the most
difficult detail of fly casting, because
the line is behind the angler and the
eye cannot aid the hand. The novice
will soon acquire the knack of casting,
however, if he will remember to keep
the elbow close to the side, and to
keep the line well up in the air when
making the back cast, and to begin the
forward movement before the line has
fully straightened out behind him.
After a little practice, the hand will
feel the slight tension communicated
to the rod as the line begins to
straighten out, and this should be
taken advantage of to correctly time
the forward movement. Counting
"one" for the upstroke,
"two and"
for the interval required
for the line
to straighten out
in the rear, and
"three" for the
forward movement,
is also a
good way to time
the cast.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning
the caster
should make no
attempt to secure
distance. Accuracy
and delicacy
in placing the fly
on the water is of
much more importance
than
length of cast in
trout fishing, and
to attain this end,
it is a good plan
to place a newspaper
about 25&nbsp;ft.
distant and try to drop the end of the
line on this mark. When the caster
can drop the line on the target lightly
and with reasonable accuracy, he may
feel justified in lengthening his cast.
Other casts than the overhead cast just
described are occasionally used, as the
Spey, switch, wind, and flip casts, but
the overhead cast is mostly used, although
it is much more difficult to master.
</p>

<p>
To make the Spey cast, the angler
requires a rapid stream which will
carry the line downstream until it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>[81]</a></span>
straight and taut, the tip of the rod
being held as long as possible to accomplish
this end. The rod is then
raised high in the air with a quick
wrist movement, which lifts the line
from the water to the extreme end,
then without pausing the rod is carried
upstream with just sufficient force
to let the fly fall just above the angler.
The line is now on the reverse, or upper,
side of the fisherman, when with
a sweep of the rod
the line is projected
over the
water's surface&mdash;not
along the surface&mdash;in
the manner
used in making
the overhead
cast.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img081'>
  <img src='images/img081.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Fig.&nbsp;3&mdash;The Rod is Quickly Checked When It is
Carried over the Shoulder About 25 Degrees</p>
</div>

<p>
The switch cast
is sometimes useful
when trees or
rocks are immediately
back of the
fisherman, thus
preventing the
line from extending
far enough
backward to
make the overhead
cast. In making
this cast the
line is not lifted
from the water,
but merely to the
surface by raising
the tip of the rod.
The line is
dragged through
the water by carrying
the tip in
the direction one
is standing until
it is as far in the rear as the obstructions
will permit. By a quick downward
sweep of the rod the line is projected
with sufficient force to roll it
forward in a large coil or loop, much
as a wheel rolls on a track.
</p>

<p>
The wind cast is a modification of
the switch cast, but easier to make.
The caster brings his line almost to
his feet, and with a quick downward
motion of the rod the line is thrown
in a long loop against the wind. The
underhand and the flip casts are so
simple that it seems almost unnecessary
to describe them. Both are
short casts and are only used when the
angler is fishing in an overgrown
stream. The underhand cast is really
a side cast, inasmuch as the short line
is lifted from the water in a loop and
propelled in the desired direction by a
side sweep of the rod. The flip cast
is made by holding
the fly between
the thumb
and finger and
with a few coils
of line in the right
hand. Bend the
rod like a bow, release
the fly suddenly,
and the
snap of the rod
will project it in
the desired direction
and allow it
to drop lightly
like a fly.
</p>
<h3>Handling the Flies in the Water</h3>
<p>
As a general
thing the veteran
fly fisherman prefers
to wade with
the current and
fishes the water in
front of him by
making diagonal
casts across the
stream. A good
fisherman will
systematically
cover every inch
of good water and
little will be left to chance. The novice
is inclined to fish his flies in a contrary
manner, he casts more or less at
random, and is as likely to splash the
flies recklessly about in the most impossible
places as he is to drop them
in a favorable riffle or pool. To be able
to pick out fishable water, the angler
should know something about the
habits of the trout, their characteristics
at the several seasons of the fishing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>[82]</a></span>
year, and their habits, which differ
greatly in different streams. A fishing
knowledge of the stream to be
visited is of much value, but if the
angler knows how to make a fair cast
and possesses average skill in handling
flies on water, there should be no question
but that he will creel a fair number
of trout even though he casts in
strange waters.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img082'>
  <img src='images/img082.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Fig.&nbsp;4&mdash;The Cast is Finished by Throwing the Line
Forward with a Quick Wrist-and-Forearm Movement</p>
</div>

<p>
To imitate the action of the natural
insect is the most successful manner of
fishing the flies, and as the natural fly
will struggle more or less when borne
down with the
current, the fisherman
endeavors to
duplicate this
movement by
making his artificial
fly wriggle
about. This motion
must not be
overdone, for if
the flies are
twitched and
skipped about, or
pulled against the
current, the wary
trout will refuse to
fall for any such
obvious deceit. A
gentle motion of
the wrist will
cause the fly to
move somewhat
as the natural insect
will struggle.
</p>

<p>
In making the
cast do not cast
directly down or
upstream, but across the current at an
angle. Let the flies fall upon the
water as lightly as possible, so that the
water will carry them downstream
over the likely places where the trout
are hiding. Keep the line as taut as
possible by drawing the slack in with
the left hand. The flies should not
be allowed to soak in the water,
neither should they be retrieved in
haste. The experienced fly caster will
invariably fish with a wet line, that is
to say, with a slightly submerged fly,
and will let the flies drag over as much
water as possible before making a second
cast. Owing to the fact that trout
lie with their noses pointing upstream
awaiting their food carried down by
the current, the caster will naturally
take pains to float his flies downstream
with the leader fairly taut. To
neglect this detail and allow the leader
to float in a wide loop near or before
the flies is slovenly fishing, and few
trout will strike a fly presented in this
amateurish fashion.
</p>

<p>
Early in the fishing season, and when
the stream is flooded and discolored
after a heavy rain,
it is a good plan to
fish the flies below
the surface.
Fishing in this
manner makes it
more difficult to
tell when to strike
a fish, and some
little practice is
needed to determine
the opportune
moment by
feeling the slight
tension on the
line. Many fish
will be pricked to
be sure, but some
trout will be
creeled, and fishing
with the submerged
fly is
sometimes the
only way trout
can be taken.
</p>

<p>
On fair days
and in smooth
water, better luck may be expected
when the fly is kept upon the surface,
and this is easily managed by keeping
the tip of the rod well in the air.
Often the fisherman can take advantage
of a bit of floating foam, and if
the fly is cast upon it and allowed to
float with it downstream, the ruse will
often prove effective.
</p>

<p>
The trout is a hard striker and it is
not unusual to have a trout rush ahead
of the fly in his attempt to mouth it.
In rapid water the savage rush of the
fish is sufficient to hook it securely,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>[83]</a></span>
but when casting in quiet pools, the
hook is imbedded by a snap of the
wrist. At what exact moment to
strike, as well as the amount of force
to use, depends upon circumstances.
When fishing in small streams and
brooks where the trout run small,
much less force is necessary to hook
the fish, but in quiet water and in
larger streams where 2 or 3-lb. trout
are not uncommon, the fish may be
struck with a smart upward jerk of the
forearm and wrist. So far as my experience
goes, the matter of striking
is governed by the temperament as
well as the judgment of the angler.
The deliberate thinking man is likely
to strike too late, while the nervous
individual, striking too early, is apt to
prick the trout and roll him over.
</p>

<p>
The best time to fish for trout is
when they are feeding on the surface;
and in the early days of spring, when
there are few flies about, the warmer
part of the day, say, from 10&nbsp;in the
morning to 5&nbsp;in the afternoon, will
prove to be the most successful time.
Later on, when flies are numerous,
good luck may be expected at an early
hour in the morning, and in the hot
summer months the cooler hours of
the day may be chosen. Of course,
there are many exceptions, since there
are many cool days in summer, as well
as exceptionally warm days in spring,
and these changes of weather should
be considered. However, extremes are
not likely to make good fishing, and
the trout will not rise as freely on cold,
windy days, nor will they fight as
gamely. On hot days, too, not so
much luck can be expected during the
hours of the greatest heat&mdash;12 to 4&mdash;but
a good basket of trout may be
creeled early in the morning or late
in the afternoon of summer. A bright,
clear day is usually the best for fly
fishing, because the sun brings out
more flies, but a warm rain, or even a
fog, is also considered good fishing
weather.
</p>

<p>
Among the live baits available for
trout fishing are the minnow, white
grub, cricket, grasshopper, and other
insects, and last, but by no means least,
the common angle or earthworm. The
minnow is beyond a doubt the most
enticing morsel that can be offered to a
hungry trout, and a minnow may be
reckoned to secure a rise when other
baits fail. The inconvenience of transporting
this bait is a great drawback,
and as minnows are delicate fish, a
minnow bucket is necessary for their
preservation. This means a lot of
trouble, as the water must be frequently
changed or aerated, and this
labor, together with the difficulty of
carrying a bulky pail through the
brush, makes this desirable bait almost
impossible for stream and brook fishing.
The salt-water minnow, known
as a "shiner" or "mummychug," is a
topnotch trout bait, and being much
tougher than the fresh-water minnow,
makes a bait often used by anglers residing
near the seacoast.
</p>

<p>
The white grub, or larvae of the so-called
May beetle, is a good bait available
for early-season fishing, and may
be obtained in the early spring months
by spading up grass land. The grub
is about 1&nbsp;in. long, and of a creamy
yellow color with a darker head. It
may be kept a month, or more, by putting
it in a box with a number of
pieces of fresh turf.
</p>

<p>
Crickets, grasshoppers, and many
other insects, make good baits, while
the earthworm is a good all-around
bait for trout. A supply dug some
days before and kept by packing in
fresh moss and slightly moistening
with milk and water will prove more
attractive in appearance and the worms
will be tougher and cleaner to handle
than when carried in earth.
</p>

<p>
Other good baits include the fin of
a trout, and if this is used in combination
with the eye of the same fish,
it forms an attractive lure. In using
this bait, do not puncture the eyeball,
but hook through the thin flexible skin
surrounding the eye. A fat piece of
salt pork, cut into pieces 1&nbsp;in. long
and 1/4&nbsp;in. wide, makes a fairly good
bait. Spoons and other spinning baits
are presumably attractive, but few
sportsmen use them when angling for
so fine a fish as trout.

<h2>
Houses Made of Poles<br />
By Lola A. Pinchon
</h2>



<div class='blkquot'>
<p>
[In this article descriptions are given of several shelters suitable for a resort, but the reader
may select any one of them that answers his needs and build a camp house, or fit up a more
substantial one to make living quarters for the whole year.&mdash;Editor.]
</p>
</div>

<p>
Being forced to take the open-air
treatment to regain health, a person
adopted the plan of building a pole
house in the woods, and the scheme was
so successful that it was decided to
make a resort grounds, to attract
crowds during holidays, by which an
income could be realized for living expenses.
All the pavilions, stands, furniture,
and amusement devices were
constructed of straight poles cut from
young growth of timber with the bark
remaining on them. Outside of boards
for flooring and roofing material, the
entire construction of the buildings and
fences consisted of poles.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img085b'>

  <p>The Frame Construction of the House Made
Entirely of Rough Poles, the Verticals being Set in the Ground, Plumbed,
and Sighted to Make a Perfect Rectangle of the Desired Proportions</p>
</div>

<p>
A level spot was selected and a house
built having three rooms. The location
was in a grove of young timbers, most
of it being straight, and 13 trees were
easily found that would make posts 12&nbsp;ft. long, required for the sides, and two
poles 16&nbsp;ft. long, for the center of the
ends, so that they would reach to the
ridge. The plot was laid out rectangular
and marked for the poles, which
were set in the ground for a depth of 4&nbsp;ft., at distances of 6&nbsp;ft. apart. This
made the house 8&nbsp;ft. high at the eaves
with a square pitch roof; that is, the
ridge was 3&nbsp;ft. high in the center from
the plate surfaces for this width of a
house. The rule for finding this height
is to take one-quarter of the width of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>[86]</a></span>
the house for the height in the center
from the plate.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img086a'>
  <img src='images/img086a.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Steps are Supported on Pairs of Vertical Poles
Set in the Ground to Make Different Levels</p>
</div>

<p>
The corner poles were carefully located
to make the size 12 by 24&nbsp;ft., with
a lean-to 8 by 12&nbsp;ft., and then plumbed
to get them straight vertically. The
plates for the sides, consisting of five
poles, were selected as straight as possible
and their ends and centers hewn
down to about one-half their thickness,
as shown at A and B, and nailed to the
tops of the vertical poles, the connection
for center poles being as shown at C.
</p>

<p>
The next step was to secure the vertical
poles with crosspieces between
them which were used later for supporting
the siding. These poles were cut
about 6&nbsp;ft. long, their ends being cut
concave to fit the curve of the upright
poles, as shown at D. These were
spaced evenly, about 2&nbsp;ft. apart from
center to center, on the sides and ends,
as shown in the sketch, and toenailed
in place. The doors and window openings
were cut in the horizontal poles
wherever wanted, and casements set
in and nailed. The first row of horizontal
poles was placed close to the ground
and used both as support for the lower
ends of the siding and to nail the ends
of the flooring boards to, which were
fastened in the center to poles laid on
stones, or, better still, placed on top of
short blocks, 5&nbsp;ft. long, set in the
ground. These poles for the floor
should be placed not over 2&nbsp;ft. apart
to make the flooring solid.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img086b'>
  <img src='images/img086b.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Gate Openings were Made in the Fence Where
Necessary, and Gates of Poles Hung
in the Ordinary Manner</p>
</div>

<p>
A lean-to was built by setting three
poles at a distance of 8&nbsp;ft. from one
side, beginning at the center and extending
to the end of the main building.
These poles were about 6&nbsp;ft. long above
the ground. The rafter poles for this
part were about 9-1/2&nbsp;ft. long, notched
at both ends for the plates, the ends of
the house rafters being sawed off even
with the outside of the plate along this
edge. The rafter poles for the house
were 10&nbsp;in all, 8&nbsp;ft. long, and were laid
off and cut to fit a ridge made of a
board. These poles were notched
about 15&nbsp;in. from their lower ends to
fit over the rounding edge of the plate
pole, and were then placed directly over
each vertical wall pole. They were
nailed both to the plate and to the
ridge, also further strengthened by a
brace made of a piece of board or a
small pole, placed under the ridge and
nailed to both rafters. On top of the
rafters boards were placed horizontally,
spaced about 1&nbsp;ft. apart, but this is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>[87]</a></span>
optional with the builder, as other roofing
material can be used. In this
instance metal roofing was used, and
it only required fastening at intervals,
and to prevent rusting out, it was well
painted on the under side before laying
it and coated on the outside when fastened
in place. If a more substantial
shelter is wanted, it is best to lay the
roof solid with boards, then cover it
with the regular prepared roofing material.
</p>

<p>
Some large trees were selected and
felled, then cut into 4-ft. lengths and
the bark removed, or if desired, the
bark removed in 4-ft. lengths, and
nailed on the outside of the poles,
beginning at the bottom in the same
manner as laying shingles, to form the
siding of the house. If a more substantial
house is wanted, boards can be
nailed on the poles, then the bark fastened
to the boards; also, the interior
can be finished in wall board.
</p>

<p>
The same general construction is
used for the porch, with horizontal
poles latticed, as shown, to form the
railing. It is very easy to make ornamental
parts, such as shown, on the
eave of the porch, by splitting sticks
and nailing them on closely together
to make a frieze. Floors are laid on the
porch and in the house, and doors hung
and window sash fitted in the same
manner as in an ordinary house.
</p>

  <p>All Furniture, Together with the Large Lawn
Swings, Took on the General Appearance of the
Woodland, and As the Pieces were Made Up
of the Same Material As the Houses, the
Cost Was Only the Labor and a Few Nails</p>
</div>

<p>
A band stand was constructed on
sloping ground, and after setting the
poles, the floor horizontals were placed
about 2&nbsp;ft. above the ground, on the
upper side, and 4&nbsp;ft. on the lower side.
The poles used were about 18&nbsp;ft. long.
Instead of having the horizontals 2&nbsp;ft.
apart, the first was placed 1&nbsp;ft. above
the floor, the next at about one-half the
distance from the lower one to the plate
at the top, and the space between was
ornamented with cross poles, as shown.
A balcony or bay was constructed at
one end, and a fancy roof was made of
poles whose ends rested on a curved
pole attached to the vertical pieces.
Steps were formed of several straight
poles, hewn down on their ends to make
a level place to rest on horizontal pieces
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>[88]</a></span>
attached to stakes at the ends. A pair
of stakes were used at each end of a
step, and these were fastened to a slanting
piece at the top, their lower ends
being set into the ground. The manner
of bracing and crossing with horizontals
makes a rigid form of construction,
and if choice poles are selected for the
step pieces, they will be comparatively
level and of sufficient strength to hold
up all the load put on them. The roof
of this building was made for a sun
shade only and consisted of boards
nailed closely together on the rafters.
</p>

  </a>
  <p>The Entrance to the Grounds was Given an Inviting
Appearance with Large Posts and Swinging Gates</p>
</div>

<p>
An ice-cream parlor was built on the
same plan, but without any board floor;
the ground, being level, was used
instead. There were five vertical poles
used for each end with a space left
between the two poles at the center, on
both sides, for an entrance. This building
was covered with prepared roofing,
so that the things kept for sale could
be protected in case of a shower.
</p>

<p>
A peanut stand was also built without
a floor, and to make it with nine
sides, nine poles were set in the ground
to form a perfect nonagon and joined
at their tops with latticed horizontals.
Then a rafter was run from the top of
each post to the center, and boards were
fitted on each pair of rafters over the
V-shaped openings. The boards were
then covered with prepared roofing.
A railing was formed of horizontals
set in notches, cut in the posts, and then
ornamented in the same manner as for
the other buildings.
</p>

<p>
Fences were constructed about the
grounds, made of pole posts with horizontals
on top, hewn down and fitted
as the plates for the house; and the
lower pieces were set in the same as
for making the house railing. Gates
were made of two vertical pieces, the
height of the posts, and two horizontals,
then braced with a piece running
from the lower corner at the hinge side
to the upper opposite corner, the other
cross brace being joined to the sides of
the former, whereupon two short horizontals
were fitted in the center. A
blacksmith formed some hinges of rods
and strap iron, as shown, and these
were fastened in holes bored in the post
and the gate vertical. A latch was made
by boring a hole through the gate vertical
and into the end of the short piece.
Then a slot was cut in the side to receive
a pin inserted in a shaft made to
fit the horizontal hole. A keeper was
made in the post by boring a hole to
receive the end of the latch.
</p>

<p>
Large posts were constructed at the
entrance to the grounds, and on these
double swing gates, made up in the
same manner as the small one, were
attached. These large posts were built
up of four slender poles and were considerably
higher than the fence poles.
The poles were set in a perfect square,
having sides about 18&nbsp;in. long, and a
square top put on by mitering the corners,
whereupon four small rafters were
fitted on top. The gates were swung
on hinges made like those for the small gate.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>[89]</a></span>
Among the best and most enjoyed
amusement devices on the grounds
were the swings. Several of these were
built, with and without tables. Four
poles, about 20&nbsp;ft. long, were set in the
ground at an angle, and each pair of
side poles was joined with two horizontals,
about 12&nbsp;ft. long, spreaders being
fastened between the two horizontals
to keep the tops of the poles evenly
spaced. The distance apart of the poles
will depend on the size of the swing
and the number of persons to be seated.
Each pair of side poles are further
strengthened with crossed poles, as
shown. If no table is to be used in
the swing, the poles may be set closer
together, so that the top horizontals
will be about 8&nbsp;ft. long. The platform
for the swinging part consists of two
poles, 12&nbsp;ft. long, which are swung on
six vertical poles, about 14&nbsp;ft. long.
These poles are attached to the top horizontals
with long bolts, or rods, running
through both, the bottom being
attached in the same manner. Poles
are nailed across the platform horizontals
at the bottom for a floor, and a
table with seats at the ends is formed
of poles. The construction is obvious.
</p>

<p>
A short space between two trees can
be made into a seat by fastening two
horizontals, one on each tree, with the
ends supported by braces. Poles are
nailed on the upper surface for a seat.
</p>

<p>
Other furniture for the house and
grounds was made of poles in the manner
illustrated. Tables were built for
picnickers by setting four or six poles
in the ground and making a top of poles
or boards. Horizontals were placed
across the legs with extending ends, on
which seats were made for the tables.
Chairs and settees were built in the
same manner, poles being used for the
entire construction.

<h2>
An Electric Water Heater
</h2>


<p>
Procure the barrel and cap from a
hand bicycle pump and prepare them
as follows: Make a tube of paper, about
double the thickness of a postal card,
to fit snugly in the pump barrel and oil
it slightly before slipping it into place.
Procure some resistance wire of the
proper length and size to heat quickly.
The wire can be tested out by coiling it
on some nonconducting material, such
as an earthen jug or glazed tile, and
connecting one end to the current
supply and running the other wire of
the supply over the coil until it heats
properly. Cut the resistance at this
point and temporarily coil it to fit into
the bottom of the pump barrel, allowing
one end to extend up through the space
in the center with sufficient length to
make a connection to supply wires.
</p>

<p>
Mix some dental plaster to the consistency
of thick cream and, while keeping
the wire in the center of the pump
barrel, pour in the mixture until it is
filled to within 1-1/2&nbsp;in. of the top. Allow
the plaster to set for about a day,
then remove it from the barrel and take
off the paper roll. The coil of wire at
the bottom is now straightened out and
wound in a coil over the outside of the
plaster core, allowing sufficient end for
connecting to the supply wires.
</p>

  <p>An Electric Heating Coil Made of Resistance Wire
Placed in a Bicycle-Pump Barrel
for Boiling Water</p>
</div>

<p>
Cut two or three disks of mica to
fit snugly in the bottom of the pump
barrel, also cut a mica sheet to make a
covering tube over the coil on the plaster
core and insert the whole into the
barrel. The two terminals are connected
to the ends of a flexible cord
which has a plug attached to the opposite
end. Be sure to insulate the ends
of the wire where they connect to the
flexible cord inside of the pump barrel
under the cap. In winding the resistance
wire on the core, be sure that one
turn does not touch the other. The
heater when connected to a current
supply and placed in 1&nbsp;qt. of water will
bring it to a boil quickly.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Camps<br />
By F. S. Charles
</h2>


<p>
A good site, pure water in abundance,
and a convenient fuel supply,
are the features of a temporary camp
that should be given first consideration
when starting out to enjoy a vacation
in the woods. The site should
be high and dry, level enough for the
tent and camp fire, and with surrounding
ground sloping enough to insure
proper drainage. A sufficient fuel
supply is an important factor, and a
spot should be chosen where great effort
is not required to collect it and
get it into proper shape for the fire.
</p>

  <img src='images/img090d.png'
  alt=''

  <p>Log Cabin</p>
</div>

<p>
When locating near streams of
water be careful to select a spot above
high water mark
so the ground will
not be overflowed
by a sudden rise
of the stream. Do
not select the site
of an old camp, as the surroundings
are usually stripped of all fuel, and
the grounds are unclean.
</p>
<h3>Division of Work</h3>
<p>
Clear the selected spot and lay out
the lines for the tent, camp fire, etc.
If the camping party consists of more
than two persons, each one should do
the part allotted to him, and the work
will be speedily accomplished. Remember
that discipline brings efficiency,
and do not be slack about a
camp just because it is pleasure. One
of the party should attend to the camp
fire and prepare the meals while another
secures the fuel and water. The
tent can be unpacked and the ground
cleared by the other members of the
party, and when ready, all should assist
in raising the tent, especially if it
is a large one.
</p>
<h3>Tents</h3>
<p>
An ordinary A or wedge tent is sufficient
for one or two campers. Where
you do not wish to locate permanently,
this tent can be set up and taken down
quickly. It should have a ring fastened
to the cloth in each peak through
which to pass a
rope or line to
take the place of
a ridge pole.
Such a tent can
be pitched
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>[91]</a></span>
between two trees or saplings, and, after
tying the rope to the trees, it can be
tightened with a long forked stick,
placed under one end of the rope. If
two trees are not conveniently located,
then two poles crossed and tied together
will make supports for one or
both ends, the ridge line running over
them and staked to the ground.
</p>

  alt=''
  />
  <p>Fire Built against a Log</p>
</div>

<p>
On a chilly night, the A tent is quite
advantageous. The stakes can be
pulled on one side and the cloth
doubled to make a lean-to, open on the
side away from the wind. A fire can
be built in front and the deflected heat
on the sleeper will keep him comfortable
and warm.
</p>

<p>
For larger parties, the wall tent with
a fly is recommended. These tents can
be purchased in various sizes. The fly
is an extra covering stretched over the
top to make an open air space between
the two roofs. It keeps the interior of
the tent delightfully cool in hot summer
weather and provides a better protection
from rain. The fly can be made
extra long, to extend over the end of
the tent, making a shady retreat which
can be used for lounging or a dining
place.
</p>
<h3>Protection from Insects</h3>
<p>
Where mosquitoes and other insects
are numerous, it is well to make a
second tent of cheesecloth with binding
tape along the top to tie it to the
ridge pole of the regular tent. The
sides should be made somewhat longer
than the regular tent so that there will
be plenty of cloth to weight it down
at the bottom. This second tent
should be made without any opening
whatever. The occupant must crawl
under the edge to enter. The cheesecloth
tent is used inside of the ordinary
tent, and when not in use it is
pushed aside.
</p>

  <p>Forked Sticks Supporting Cooking Utensils</p>
</div>

<p>
Two camps are illustrated showing
the construction of a lean-to for a temporary
one-season camp, and a log
cabin which makes a permanent place
from year to year. (A more elaborate
and more expensive camp was described
in the May issue of this magazine.)
The construction of these
camps are very simple. The first is
made of poles cut in the woods. A
ridge pole is placed between two trees
or held in place with poles of sufficient
length, set in the ground. Poles are
placed on this at an angle of about 45&nbsp;deg., forming a lean-to that will be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>[92]</a></span>
entirely open in front when finished. The
poles are covered, beginning at the
bottom, with pine boughs, laid in layers
so as to make a roof that will shed
water. A large fire, built a short distance
from the open front will make a
warm place to sleep, the heat being reflected
down the same as described for
the A tent.
</p><h3>A Permanent Camp</h3>
<p>
A good permanent camp is a log
cabin. This can be constructed of materials
found in the woods. Trees may
be felled, cut to length, and notched to
join the ends together at each corner
so as to leave little or no space between
the logs. The roof is constructed
of long clapboards, split from
blocks of wood. The builder can finish
such a camp as elaborately as he
chooses, and for this reason the site
should be selected with great care.
</p>
<h3>Camp Fires</h3>
<p>
There is no better way to make a
camp fire than to have a large log or
two against which to start a fire with
small boughs. Larger sticks can be
placed over the logs in such a way as
to hold a pot of water or to set a frying
pan. Forked sticks can be laid on
the log and weighted on the lower end
with a stone, using the upper end to
hang a cooking vessel over the flames.
Two logs placed parallel, with space
enough between for the smaller sticks,
make one of the best camp cooking arrangements.
Two forked sticks, one
at each end of the logs, may be set
in the ground and a pole placed in the
forks lengthwise of the fire. This
makes a convenient place for hanging
the cooking utensils with bent wires.
</p>


<h3>
Food Supplies
</h3>

<p>
The conditions in various localities
make a difference in the camper's appetite
and in consequence no special
list of food can be recommended, but
the amount needed by the average
person in a vacation camp for two
weeks, is about as follows:

When on a walking tour through the

several feet of small rubber tubing and
a few inches of hollow cane of the size
to fit the tube.

<h2>
Washing Photographic Prints
</h2>


<p>
The usual way of washing photographic
prints is to place them in a
shallow tray in which they will become
stuck together in bunches, if
they are not often separated. A
French magazine suggests that a deep
tank be used instead, and that each
print be attached to a cork by means
of a pin stuck through one corner, the
cork thus becoming a float which keeps
the print suspended vertically, and at
the same time prevents contact with
its nearest neighbor.

<h2>
Camp Furnishings<br />
By Chelsea Curtis Fraser
</h2>


<p>
When on a camping trip nothing
should be carried but the necessities,
and the furnishings should be made up
from materials found in the woods. A
good spring bed can be made up in the
following manner: Cut two stringers
from small, straight trees, about 4&nbsp;in.
in diameter, and make them about 6&nbsp;ft.
long. All branches are trimmed off
smooth and a trench is dug in the
ground for each piece, the trenches
being 24&nbsp;in. apart. Small saplings,
about 1&nbsp;in. in diameter, and as straight
as can be found, are cut and trimmed of
all branches, and nailed across the
stringers for the springs. Knots, bulges,
etc., should be turned downward as far
as possible. The ends of each piece
are flattened as shown at A, Fig.&nbsp;1, to
give it a good seat on the stringers.
</p>

<p>
A larger sapling is cut, flattened, and
nailed at the head of the bed across the
stringers, and to it a number of head-stay
saplings, B, are nailed. These
head-stay pieces are cut about 12&nbsp;in.
long, sharpened on one end and driven
a little way into the ground, after which
they are nailed to the head crosspiece.

  <p>A Camp Bed Made of Saplings with Several Layers
of Boughs for the Mattress (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
In the absence of an empty mattress
tick and pillow cover which can be
filled with straw, boughs of fir may be
used. These boughs should not be
larger than a match and crooked stems
should be turned down. Begin at the
head of the bed and lay a row of boughs
with the stems pointing toward the
foot. Over this row, and half-lapping
it, place another row so that the tops of
the boughs lie on the line C and their
stems on the line D. This process is
continued until the crosspiece springs
are entirely covered, and then another
layer is laid in the same manner on top
of these, and so on, until a depth of 6
or 8&nbsp;in. is obtained. This will make a
good substitute for a mattress. A pillow
can be made by filling a meal bag
with boughs or leaves.

A Table Made of Packing-Box Material and a
Wash Basin Stand of Three Stakes (Fig.&nbsp;2, Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
A good and serviceable table can be
constructed from a few fence boards, or
boards taken from a packing box. The
table and chairs are made in one piece,
the construction being clearly shown in
Fig.&nbsp;2. The height of the ends should
be about 29&nbsp;in., and the seats about 17&nbsp;in. from the ground. The other dimensions
will be governed by the material
at hand and the number of campers.
</p>

<p>
A wash-basin support can be made of
three stakes, cut from saplings and
driven in the ground, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;3. The basin is hung by its rim
between the ends of the stakes.
</p>

<p>
Wherever a suitable tree is handy, a
seat can be constructed as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;4. Bore two 1-in. holes, 8&nbsp;in.
apart, in the trunk, 15&nbsp;in. above the
ground, and drive two pins, about 12&nbsp;in. long, cut from a sapling into them.
The extending ends are supported on
legs of the same material. The seat is
made of a slab with the rounding side down.

upper end is fitted with a rope which is
tied over the ridge pole of the tent.

<h2>
A Homemade Fountain Pen
</h2>


<p>
A very serviceable fountain pen can
be made from two 38-72 rifle cartridges
and a steel pen. Clean out the cartridges,
fit a  plug tightly in
the end of one shell, and cut it off
smooth with the end of the metal. Drill
a 3/16&nbsp;in. hole in the center of the wood
plug and fit another plug into this hole
with sufficient end projecting to be
shaped for the length of the steel pen
to be used. The shank of the pen and
the plug must enter the hole together.
One side of the projecting end of the
plug should be shaped to fit the inside
surface of the pen and then cut off at
a point a little farther out than the eye
in the pen. On the surface that is to
lie against the pen a groove is cut in
the plug extending from near the point
to the back end where it is to enter
the hole in the first plug. The under
side of the plug is shaped about as shown.

<p>
The other cartridge is cut off at such
a point that it will fit on the tapering
end of the first one, and is used for a
cap. The cartridge being filled with
ink and the plug inserted, the ink will
flow down the small groove in the
feeder plug and supply the pen with
ink. Care must be taken that the surface
of the smaller plug fits the pen
snugly and that the groove is not cut
through to the point end. This will
keep the ink from flooding, and only
that which is used for writing will be
able to get through or leak out.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
A Camp Provision Box
</h2>


<p>
While on a camping-and canoeing
trip recently, I used a device which
added a touch of completeness to our
outfit and made camp life really enjoyable.
This useful device is none other
than a provision or "grub" box.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img095a'>
  <a href='images/hr_095a.png'>
    <img src='images/img095a.png'

  </a>
  <p>The Provision Box Ready for Use in Camp,
the Cover Turned Back on the Brackets
and the Legs Extended</p>
</div>

<p>
From experience campers know that
the first important factor in having a
successful trip is compactness of outfit.
When undertaking an outing of
this kind it is most desirable to have
as few bundles to
carry as possible,
especially if one is
going to be on the
move part of the
time. This device
eliminates an unnecessary amount
of bundles, thus
making the trip
easier for the
campers, and
doubly so if they
intend canoeing
part of the time;
and, apart from its
usefulness as a provision container,
it affords a general repository for the
small articles which mean so much to
the camper's welfare.
</p>

<p>
The box proper may be made of any
convenient size, so long as it is not too
cumbersome for two people to handle.
The dimensions given are for a box I
used on a canoe trip of several hundred
miles; and from experience I know it
to be of a suitable size for canoeists.
If the camper is going to have a fixed
camp and have his luggage hauled, a
larger box is much to be preferred. A
glance at the figures will show the
general proportions of the box. It may
be possible, in some cases, to secure a
strong packing box near the required
dimensions, thus doing away with the
trouble of constructing it. The distinguishing
features of this box are the
hinged cover, the folding legs, and the
folding brackets. The brackets, upon
which the top rests when open, fold in
against the back
of the box when
not in use. The
same may be said
of the legs. They
fold up alongside
the box and are
held there by
spring-brass clips.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img095b'>

  </a>
  <p>The Brackets for the Cover as Well as Each
of the Four Legs Fold Against the Sides of the Box in Such a Manner
as to be Out of the Way, Making the Box Easy to Carry and Store Away in a Small Space</p>
</div>

<p>
On our trips we
carry an alcohol
stove on which we
do all of our cooking.
The inner
side of the top is
covered with a
sheet of asbestos, this side being uppermost
when the hinged top is opened
and resting on the folding brackets.
The stove rested on this asbestos, thus
making everything safe. The cover is
large enough to do all the cooking on,
and the box is so high that the cooking
can be attended to without stooping
over, which is much more pleasant
than squatting before a camp fire getting
the eyes full of smoke. The legs
are hinged to the box in such a manner
that all of the weight of the box
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>[96]</a></span>
rests on the legs rather than on the
hinges, and are kept from spreading
apart by wire turnbuckles. These, being
just bolts and wire, may be tucked
inside the box when on the move. The
top is fitted with unexposed hinges and
with a lock to make it a safe place for
storing valuables.
</p>

  />
  <p>Detail of the Turnbuckle, Button to Hold the Brackets,
and the Spring Clip for Holding the Legs on the
Side of the Box</p>
</div>

<p>
In constructing the cover it is well
to make it so that it covers the joints
of the sides, thus making the box
waterproof from the top, if rain should
fall on it. A partition can be made in
one end to hold odds and ends. A tray
could be installed, like the tray in a
trunk, to hold knives, forks, spoons,
etc., while the perishable supplies are
kept underneath the tray. Give the
box two coats of lead paint, and shellac
the inside.
</p>

<p>
The wire braces for the legs are
made as follows. Procure four machine
bolts, about 1/4&nbsp;in. in diameter and
2&nbsp;in. long&mdash;any thread will do&mdash;with
wing nuts and washers to fit. Saw or
file off the heads and drill a small hole
in one end of each bolt, large enough
to receive a No. 16 galvanized iron
wire. Two inches from the bottom of
each leg drill a hole to take the bolt
loosely. Determine the exact distance
between the outside edges of the legs
when the box is resting on them. Make
the wire braces 1&nbsp;in. longer than this
distance so that the bolts will protrude
through the holes in the legs and allow
for putting on the nuts and washers.
Screwing up on the nuts draws the
wire taut, thus holding the legs firm.
</p>

<p>
The size of the top determines the
dimensions of the folding brackets
which support it when open. These
brackets may be solid blocks of wood,
but a lighter and more serviceable
bracket is constructed as follows. If
the top is 20&nbsp;in. wide and 30&nbsp;in. long,
make the brackets 10 by 13&nbsp;in. Constructing
the brackets so that their
combined length is 4&nbsp;in. shorter than
the total length of the box, facilitates
their folding against the back of the box
when not in use. This point is clearly
shown in the drawing. Our brackets
were made of 1/2-in. oak, 1-1/2&nbsp;in. wide,
and the joints halved together. They
are hinged to the back of the box as
shown; and when folded are held in
place by a simple catch. The weight
of the lid is sufficient to hold the brackets
in place when open, but to make
sure they will not creep when in use insert
a 1/4-in. dowel in the end of each so
that it protrudes 1/4&nbsp;in. Drill two holes
in the top to the depth of 1/4&nbsp;in., so that
when the top rests on the brackets,
these holes engage with the dowels.
In hinging the brackets to the back see
that they are high enough to support
the lid at right angles to the box.
</p>

<p>
The box here shown is made of 7/8&nbsp;in. white pine throughout. The legs
are 7/8 by 2-1/2 by 18&nbsp;in. They are fastened
to the box with ordinary strap
hinges. When folded up against the
box they do not come quite to the top
so that the box should be at least 19&nbsp;in. high for 18-in. legs. About 2&nbsp;in.
from the bottom of the legs drive in a
brad so it protrudes 1/8&nbsp;in. as shown.
This brad engages in a hole in the
spring-brass clip when folded up as
shown in the illustration.
</p>

<p>
If in a fixed camp, it is a good idea
to stand the legs in tomato cans partly
full of water. This prevents ants from
crawling up the legs into the box, but
it necessitates placing the wire braces
higher on the legs.
</p>

<p>
Our box cost us nothing but the
hardware, as we knocked some old
packing boxes to pieces and planed up
enough boards to make the sides. Of
course, the builder need not adhere to
these dimensions, for he can make the
size to suit his requirements, while the
finish is a matter of personal taste.

The camp stoves illustrated are different

are used for the legs. They are
sharpened at the lower end so that
they may be easily driven into the
ground. The rods of the one shown
in the first illustration are bent in
the form of a hook at the upper end,
and two pieces of light tire iron, with
holes in either end, are hung on these
hooks. Across these supports are
laid other pieces of the tire iron. In
the other stove, the rods have a large
head and are slipped through holes in
the four corners of the piece of heavy
sheet iron used for the top. A cotter
is slipped through a hole in each rod
just below the top, to hold the latter
in place.&mdash;Contributed by Mrs. Lelia

How to Make an Electric Fishing Signal
</h2>


<p>
A unique electric fishing signal,
which may be rigged up on a wharf
or pier, and the electric circuit so arranged
as to operate an electric bell
or buzzer, located in the fisherman's
cottage, or any other convenient place,
may be constructed as follows: Obtain
two pieces of 1/16-in. spring brass,
one 6&nbsp;in. long and 3/4&nbsp;in. wide, and the
other 7&nbsp;in. long and 1/2&nbsp;in. wide. Mount
a 2-in. brass wood screw, A, in one
end of the 6-in. piece as shown.

  alt=''
  />
  <p>Construction of the Parts to Make the Contact Points
and the Electric Connections</p>
</div>

<p>
Place over the end of the 6-in. piece
a thin sheet of insulating fiber, B, allowing
it to extend down on each side
about 1&nbsp;in. Then bend a piece of 1/16-in.
brass, C, over the insulating fiber, allowing
it to extend down on each side
the same distance as the insulating
fiber. Drill a small hole through the
lower ends of the U-shaped piece of
brass, C, the insulation, B, and the
6-in. piece, while they are all in place.
Remove the insulation and the U-shaped
brass piece, and tap the holes
in the brass for a machine screw, D.
Enlarge the hole in the 6-in piece, and
provide an insulating bushing for it
with an opening of the same diameter
as the brass machine screw. Mount
a small binding post, E, on one side of
the U-shaped piece of brass, and the
parts may then be put together and
held in place by means of the brass screw.
</p>

<p>
Drill two holes in the other end of
the 6-in piece, also two holes in one
end of the 7-in piece, and rivet them
together with two small rivets. The
7-in. piece should project beyond the
end of the 6-in. piece. A piece of thin
spring brass should be made into the
form of a spiral, F, and fastened to
the upper end of the 7-in. piece. Provision
should be made for attaching
the fishline to the inside end of the
brass spiral. A small binding post
should be soldered to either the 6-in.
or 7-in. piece, at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
If the device is set up with the head
of the brass adjusting screw in the top
of the 6-in. piece, pointing in the direction
the line to the fishing hook is
to run, and if a fish pulls upon the
line, the 7-in. piece is pulled over and
touches the point of the adjusting
screw. If a battery and bell, or buzzer,
is connected as shown, the circuit will
be completed when the 7-in. piece
comes in contact with the adjusting
screw, and the bell will ring.

Of the many homemade devices for

It consists of a string,
about 1&nbsp;ft. long, with a
knot at one end and the
other tied to a nail or
staple driven into the wall.
To hang up the broom
simply turn the string
around the handle as

be held securely, because
its weight will pull the
string taut and the knot at the end
will prevent the string from running

The device shown in the sketch is
a great help to the maker of mission
furniture as a guide on short cuts. It
consists of two pieces of wood, A and
B, preferably of oak, fastened together
at right angles by two large flat-head
screws. The pieces should be placed
exactly at right angles.

at right angles to the surface of
piece A. This device can be either
clamped on a board or merely held

<h2>
A Wind Vane
</h2>


<p>
A novelty in wind vanes is shown
in the accompanying sketch.  The
vane can be made of sheet metal
or carved from light wood. The
wings are so set on the body as to
cause the dragon to rise when the
wind strikes them. The dragon is
pivoted on a shaft running through
its center of gravity, so it will readily
turn with the wind. The tail
part may also be made to revolve
as the propeller of an aeroplane.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img099c'>
  <img src='images/img099c.png' alt='img099c' title='img099c' />
</div>

<p>
The length and size of the shaft
will depend on the dimensions
of the dragon, and
similarly, the location of
the weights on the chains
will be determined by its size and
weight. Upon these circumstances
and the varying velocities of the wind
will depend how high the dragon
will rise on its shaft, and the height
reached by it will thus serve to indicate&mdash;in
a relative manner only&mdash;the
velocity of the wind, but it
is also possible to arrange the
weights at such distances apart that
the dragon will rise to A in a 20-mile
wind, to B in a 30-mile wind, to C
in a 40-mile gale, and so on, with
as many weights as desired. This
can be done with the aid of an
anemometer, if one can be borrowed
for some time, or the device may
be taken to the
nearest weather
bureau  to  be set.&mdash;Contributed

By means of a simple arrangement of

at once, thus: 41,096 &times; 83 = 3,410,968.
A larger number which can be treated

<h2>
A Canoe Stove<br />
By F. V. Williams
</h2>


<p>
Limited space and the rocking motion
of salmon-fishing boats in a heavy
sea on the Pacific coast brought about
the construction of the canoe stove
shown in the illustration. It is made
of a discarded kerosene can whose form
is square. A draft hole is cut in one
side of the can, 4 or 5&nbsp;in. from the bottom,
and a layer of sand placed
on the bottom. Two holes are
punched through opposite sides, parallel
with the draft hole and about
3&nbsp;in. from the top edge. Rods are
run through these holes to provide a
support for the cooking utensil. The
smoke from the fire passes out at the
corners around the vessel.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img103b'>
  <img src='images/img103b.png' alt='img103b' title='img103b' />
</div>

<p>
The main reason
for making the
stove in this manner is to hold the
cooking vessel within the sides extending
above the rods. No amount of
rocking can cause the vessel to slide
from the stove top, and as the stove is
weighted with the sand, it cannot be
easily moved from the place where it
is set in the canoe.
</p>

<p>
The use of such a stove in a canoe
has the advantage that the stove can
be cleaned quickly, as the ashes and
fire can be dumped into the water and
the stove used for a storage box. The
whole thing may be tossed overboard
and a new one made for another trip.

trouble can be avoided by tacking, on

rubber cut from a discarded bicycle
tire, placing the rubber side out. The
friction of the rubber prevents any
motion of the board.&mdash;Contributed by

The length of time required for the

<h2>
Magnetic-Suspension Pendulum
</h2>


<p>
When a pendulum is not periodically
supplied with energy its amplitude
grows smaller and finally the motion
ceases, due to the resistance of the air
and the friction at the point of suspension.
Usually the suspension is in the
form of a knife edge bearing against
plates of agate; sometimes the pendulum
rod is simply attached to a very
slender and flexible spring without any
bearings. But the minimum of friction
is obtained by means of magnetic suspension,
as the following experiment will prove.
</p>

<p>
If the rod of a pendulum about 12&nbsp;in.
long, beating half seconds, is sharpened
to a needle point and suspended from
one of the poles of a magnet, it will be
found that, if set into motion, it will
continue to swing 15 times as long as
the ordinary knife-edge suspended
pendulum, and it will not stop until
after about 16 hours, while one working
on agate plates will stop in from
50 to 60 minutes. Similarly a top, provided
with a fine-pointed axis of iron,
will spin much longer when suspended
from a magnet.
</p>

<p>
Magnetic suspension is used in precision
instruments; for example, the
minute mirrors which are used in certain
telegraph systems to register writing
photographically at the receiving end.

<p>
The dimensions given in the drawing
will be found satisfactory, but these
may be altered to suit the conditions.
The first step will be to cut and make
the sides. Nail
the two pieces
forming each side
together and then
cut the end boards
and nail them to
the sides. Lay
this framework,
bottom side up,
on a level surface
and proceed to
nail on the bottom
boards across
the sides. The
ends of these
boards are sawed
off flush with the
outside surface of
the sides after they are nailed in place.
The material list calls for tongue-and-groove
boards for the bottom, but plain
boards can be used, although it is then
difficult to make the joint water-tight.
When the tongue-and-groove boards
are used a piece of string, well soaked
in white lead or paint and placed in the
groove of each board, will be sufficient
to make a tight joint.
</p>

<p>
Having finished the sides and bottom,
the next step will be to fasten on
the bottom keel. Adjust the board to
its position and nail it in the center
part where it lies flat on the bottom
boards, then work toward the ends,
gradually drawing it down over the
turn and nailing it down. If the keel
board cannot be bent easily, it is best
to soak it in hot water where the bend
takes place and the wood can then be
nailed down without the fibers breaking.
The inside keel is put on in the
same manner, but reversed.

The next procedure is to make the
paddle wheels.  The hub for each
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>[106]</a></span>
wheel is made of a 2-in. square piece
of timber, 9&nbsp;in. long. Trim off the
corners to make 8 sides to the piece,
then bore a 3/4-in. hole through its
center. The 8 blades of each wheel,
16&nbsp;in all, are 17&nbsp;in. long, 6&nbsp;in. wide and
3/4&nbsp;in. thick. One end of each blade is
nailed to one side of the hub, then it
is braced as shown to strengthen the wheel.

<p>
The cranks are made of round iron,
3/4&nbsp;in. in diameter, and they are keyed
to the wheels with large nails in the
manner shown. I had a blacksmith
shape the cranks for me, but if one
has a forge, the work can be done at
home without that expense. The bearings
for the crankshafts consist of
wood, although it is preferable to use
for this purpose two large iron washers,
having a hole slightly larger than
the diameter of the shaft, and drill
holes in their rims so that they can
be screwed to the wheel-box upright
as shown. The bearings thus made are
lubricated with a little lard or grease.

  <p>Detail of Paddle-Wheel Fastening, the Springboard
Construction and the Fastening for the Rudder Control</p>
</div>

<p>
The paddle-wheel boxes are built
over the wheels with the dimensions
given in the drawing, to prevent the
splashing of water on the occupants
of the boat.
</p>

<p>
The trimmings for the boat consist
of three seats, a running board and a
springboard. The drawings show the
location of the seats. The springboard
is built up of 4 boards, 3/4&nbsp;in. thick, as
shown, only nailing them together at
the back end. This construction allows
the boards to slide over each
other when a person's weight is on
the outer end. The action of the
boards is the same as of a spring on
a vehicle.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to have a good brace
across the boat for the back end of
the springboard to catch on&mdash;a 2 by
4-in. timber being none too large. At
the point where the springboard rests
on the front seat there should be
another good-sized crosspiece. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>[107]</a></span>
board can be held in place by a cleat
and a few short pieces of rope, the
cleat being placed across the board
back of the brace. A little diving platform
is attached on the outer end of
the springboard and a strip of old
carpet or gunny sack placed on it to
prevent slivers from running into the
flesh. In making the spring and running
board, it is advisable to make
them removable so that the boat can
be used for other purposes.
</p>

<p>
The boat is steered with a foot-operated
lever, the construction of which
is clearly shown. For the tiller-rope
guides, large screweyes are used and
also for the rudder hinges, the pin of
the hinge being a large nail. The hull
can be further strengthened by putting
a few angle-iron braces either on the
in or outside.
</p>

<p>
To make the boat water-tight will
require calking by filling the cracks
with twine and white lead or thick
paint. The necessary tools are a broad,
dull chisel and a mallet. A couple of
coats of good paint, well brushed into
the cracks, will help to make it watertight
as well as shipshape. The boat
may leak a little when it is first put
into the water, but after a few hours
of soaking, the boards will swell and
close the openings.
</p>

<p>
This boat was used for carrying
trunks, firewood, rocks, sand, and for
fishing, and last, but not least, for
swimming. The boat is capable of
carrying a load of three-quarters of a
ton. It draws very little water, thereby
allowing its use in shallow water.
It has the further advantage that the
operator faces in the direction the boat
is going, furnishing the power with his
hands and steering with his feet.

The camper who desires to "rough

only the necessities will find it quite a
comfort to construct the bedding from
grass or moss by weaving it in the
manner of making a rag carpet, using
heavy twine or small rope as the warp.
Two stakes are set the width of the
bed or mattress to be made, and a cross
stick is attached to their tops. Several
stakes are set parallel with the cross
stick and at a distance to make the
length of the mattress. The warp is
tied between the tops of the stakes and
the cross stick. An equal number of
cords are then attached to the cross
stick and to another loose cross stick
which is used to move the cords up and
down while the grass or moss is placed
in for the woof. The ends of the warp
are then tied to hold it together. When
breaking up camp the cords can be removed
and carried to the next camp.&mdash;Contributed

How to Make a War Kite<br />
By Park Snyder
</h2>


<div class='imgfr' >
<img src='images/img108c.png' style='width:200px;' alt='kite' title='kite' />
</div>
<p>
The material required for the making
of a war kite is three pine sticks, each
60&nbsp;in. long, one stick 54&nbsp;in. long, one
stick 18&nbsp;in. long, all 1/2&nbsp;in. square; 4
yd. of cambric; a box of tacks; some
linen thread, and 16&nbsp;ft. of stout twine.
</p>

<p>
Place two 60-in. sticks parallel with
each other and 18&nbsp;in. apart, then lay
the 54-in. piece across at right angles
to them 18&nbsp;in. from the upper ends, as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;1, and fasten the joints
with brads. At a point 21&nbsp;in. below
this crosspiece, attach the 18-in. crosspiece.
</p>

<p>
The extending ends of all the three
long pieces are notched, Fig.&nbsp;2, and the
line is stretched taut around them, as
shown by the dotted lines.
</p>

<div class='imgfl' id='img108' style='width:220px;'>

  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Line should
be a Very Strong
One, Then Banners
can be
Flown on It</p>
</div>

<p>
If the cambric is not of sufficient size
to cover the frame, two pieces must be
sewed together, then a piece cut out to
the shape of the string, allowing 1&nbsp;in. to
project all around for a lap. The cambric
is sewn fast to the string with the
linen thread. Fasten the cloth to the
frame part with the tacks, spacing
them 1&nbsp;in. apart. The space in the
center, between the sticks, is cut
out. Make two pieces of the remaining
goods, one 36&nbsp;in. by 18&nbsp;in., and the other 36&nbsp;in.
by 21&nbsp;in. The remaining 60-in.
stick is fastened to these pieces of
cambric, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;3, and
the whole is fastened to the main
frame so as to make a V-shaped
projection. The bridle strings,
for giving the proper distribution of
pull on the line to the kite, are
fastened, one to the upper end of the
long stick in the V-shaped piece
attached to the kite, and the other
to the lower end, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;4. The inclination can be
varied to suit the builder by changing
the point of attachment
of the kite
line to the bridle. If it
is desired to fly the kite
directly overhead, attach
the line above the regular
point and for low flying make
the connection below this point.
The regular point is found by trial
flights with the line fastened temporarily
to the bridle, after which the
fastening is made permanent.

<h2>
Paper Glider That Loops the Loop<br />
By C. A. Thompson
</h2>


<p>
The usual paper
glider shaped as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;1 can
be made to loop the
loop and make corkscrew
flights if prepared
according to
sketches herewith.
It should be carefully
made in the
first place so that in
its regular form it
flies perfectly
straight.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img109'>

Different Flights
(Fig.&nbsp;1, Fig.&nbsp;2, Fig.&nbsp;3, Fig.&nbsp;4, Fig.&nbsp;5, Fig.&nbsp;6, Fig.&nbsp;7, Fig.&nbsp;8)</p>
</div>

<p>
To make the glider
loop, the rear corners
of the wings
should be turned up at right angles, as
in Fig.&nbsp;2, and the glider launched with
a great deal of force with the nose
pointed slightly upward. This will require
some practice, but one soon learns
the trick. After looping once, as shown
in Fig.&nbsp;3, the glider descends in volplane.
This form of glider will also
right itself, if dropped from a height,
nose downward, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;4.
</p>

<p>
For a corkscrew flight the glider is
prepared as in Fig.&nbsp;5; one rear corner
being bent up and the other down. In
this form it flies horizontally, or downward,
while rapidly rotating around its
longitudinal axis, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;6.
</p>

<p>
To make a spiral descent, the rear
corners of the wings are bent up as in
Fig.&nbsp;2, and, further, the rear corner
of the keel is bent at right angles, Fig.
7, whereupon it is thrown in the ordinary
manner. It then takes the course
shown in Fig.&nbsp;8.

  <p>The Brass-Tack Heads Holding the Numerals in
Place Constitute the Combination Points</p>
</div>

<p>
The three numerals, 1, 2, and 4, or
any other combination of numbers
constituting the house number on a
door, are made of some kind of insulating
material and fastened in place
on a base of insulating fiber, or wood,
about 1/4&nbsp;in. thick, by means of ordinary
brass-headed tacks, as indicated
by the black dots. The tacks will extend
through the base a short distance
so the electrical connections may be
made by soldering wires to them, as
shown by the diagram, alternate tacks
being connected together with the exception
of three; for instance, A, B, and C.
</p>

<p>
The terminals of the leads that are
connected to alternate tacks are in turn
connected to the terminals of a circuit
composed of an ordinary vibrating
bell, D, and battery, E. If any two
adjacent tack heads be connected together,
except tacks A, B, and C, the
bell circuit will be completed and the
bell ring, which will serve as an indication
that some one is tampering with
the circuit. The person knowing the
combination, connects the tack heads A
and B, and at the same time connects
the tack head C with F or G, or any
other tack head that is connected to
the plus side of the battery, whereby
a circuit will be completed through the
lock H and the door is opened. Any
metallic substance, such as a knife,
key, or finger ring, may be used in
making the above indicated connection,
and there will be no need of carrying
a key for this particular door so
long as the combination is known.
</p>

<p>
The base upon which the numbers
are mounted and through which the
points of the tacks protrude, should
be mounted on a second base that has
a recess cut in its surface to accommodate
the wires and points of the tacks.
</p>

<p>
The combination may be made more
or less complicated, as desired, by
connecting the tacks in different ways,
and by using a separate battery for
the bell and lock. The circuit leading
to the door lock, if there is one already
installed, may be used and then no
extra circuit is needed.
</p>

<p>
Such a device has been used on a
private-desk drawer with entire satisfaction.
The battery was placed in
the back end of the drawer, and if it
happened to fail, a new one could be
connected to the points B and J so
that the drawer could be opened and
a new battery put in.

An Aeroplane Kite<br />

After building a number of kites

the aeroplane kite shown in
the illustration, which has excited considerable
comment in the neighborhood
on account of its appearance and behavior
in the air.

  <p>The Kite Being Tailless Rides the Air Waves Like
an Aeroplane in a Steady Breeze</p>
</div>

<p>
The main frame consists of a center-stick,
A, 31&nbsp;in. long, and two cross-sticks,
of which one, B, is 31&nbsp;in. long
and the other, C, 15-1/2&nbsp;in. long. The
location of the crosspieces on the
centerpiece A is shown in the sketch,
the front piece B being 1-3/4&nbsp;in. from the
end, and the rear piece C, 2-1/4&nbsp;in. from
the other end. The ends of the sticks
have small notches cut to receive a
string, D, which is run around the outside
to make the outline of the frame
and to brace the parts. Two cross-strings
are placed at E and F, 7&nbsp;in.
from either end of the centerpiece A,
other brace strings being crossed, as
shown at G, and then tied to the cross-string
F on both sides, as at H.

</div>

<p>
The long crosspiece B is curved upward
to form a bow, the center of
which should be 3-1/4&nbsp;in. above the
string by which its ends are tied together.
The shorter crosspiece is bent
and tied in the same manner to make
the curve 2-1/2&nbsp;in., and the centerpiece
to curve 1-3/4&nbsp;in., both upward. The
front and rear parts, between the end
and the cross-strings E and F, are
covered with yellow tissue paper,
which is pasted to the crosspieces and
strings. The small wings L are purple
tissue paper, 4&nbsp;in. wide at M and tapering
to a point at N.
</p>

<p>
The bridle string is attached on the
centerpiece A at the junction of the
crosspieces B and C, and must be adjusted
for the size and weight of the
kite. The kite is tailless and requires
a steady breeze to make it float in the
air currents like an aeroplane.
</p>

<p>
The bridle string and the bending
of the sticks must be adjusted until
the desired results are obtained. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>[112]</a></span>
bridle string should be tied so that
it will about center under the cross-stick
B for the best results, but a
slight change from this location may
be necessary to make the kite ride
the air currents properly. The center
of gravity will not be the same in the
construction of each kite and the string
can be located only by trial, after
which it is permanently fastened.

  <p>Homemade Still for Removing the Impurities in Water

<p>
Pure water, free from all foreign substances,
is frequently wanted for making
up photographic solutions and
many other purposes. An apparatus
for distilling water can be very easily
made from galvanized pipe fittings.
The outer cooling jacket A is a piece
of 1-in. pipe, 2&nbsp;ft. long, threaded on
both ends, and bored and tapped for
1/2-in. pipe at B and C. A hole is bored
and tapped for 1/2-in. pipe in each of
the two caps used on the ends of the
pipe A, and a piece of 1/2-in. pipe, D,
2&nbsp;ft. 8&nbsp;in. long, is run through the holes
as shown. The joints are soldered to
make them water-tight. Two 1/2-in.
nipples, 4&nbsp;in. long, are screwed in at B
and C. The retort, or boiler, E, in
which the impure water is boiled may
be made of any suitable vessel and
heated with a Bunsen or gas burner.
A beaker, or other vessel, F, is placed
below the lower end of the small pipe.
The cold water from the faucet, which
flows into the outer jacket at C and
out at B, condenses the steam in the
small pipe D, turning it into water
which falls into the beaker in large
drops. The water is often distilled a
second time to remove any impurities
which it might still contain.&mdash;Contributed

Tandem Monoplane Glider<br />
By George F. Mace
</h2>


<p>
The monoplane glider illustrated has
better fore-and-aft stability than the
biplane, is lighter in proportion to the
supporting surface, simpler to build,
and requires very little time to assemble
or take apart. The material list
is as follows:

The first thing to do is to make the
main frame which is composed of the
four bamboo
poles. The poles
take the corners
of a 2-ft.
square space and
are supported
with the pieces of
spruce that are 2&nbsp;ft. and 3&nbsp;ft. long,
the shorter lengths running horizontally
and the longer upright, so that
each upright piece extends 1&nbsp;ft. above
the two upper poles. All joints should
be fastened with 3/16-in. stove bolts.
The wire used to truss the glider is
No. 16 gauge piano wire. The trussing
is done in all directions, crossing the
wires between the frame parts, except
in the center or space between the four poles.

<p>
The framework of the main wings is
put together by bolting one of the
crosspieces at each end of two wing
bars, then another 4&nbsp;ft. from each end,
whereupon the wing bars are bolted
to the main frame. The frame is then
braced diagonally between these
pieces. The ribs, spaced 1&nbsp;ft. apart,
are fastened to this frame with 1-in.
brads. The ribs are so bent that the
highest part will be 5 or 6&nbsp;in. above
the horizontal. The bending must be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>[114]</a></span>
uniform and is done when fastening
them in place.
</p>

<p>
The material used to cover the wings
and rudders is strong muslin. The
cloth is first tacked to the front wing
bar, then to the ribs, and sewed to a
wire which is fastened between the
ends of the ribs. Large brass-head
tacks should be used through a strip
of tape to fasten the cloth to the ribs.
The rear wings are constructed in a
similar manner. After the cloth is in
place it is coated with starch or varnish.

wings, are covered with cloth to act as
a rudder. The upper and lower bracing
wires for the wings are attached
with snaps and rings so that the glider
can be easily taken apart.
</p>

<p>
It is best not to use the glider in a
wind greater than 30 miles an hour.
It is started from the top of a hill in
the usual manner. Glides can be made
running from 60 to several hundred feet.

shown in the sketch will be a great assistance.
The truck is constructed on
the folding plan, similar to a go-cart,
and can be carried on the side of the
case. The wheels are those used on a
go-cart, with rubber tires and about 6&nbsp;in. in diameter. These are fitted to
standards carrying a hinged top piece,
the upper ends of the standards being
hinged in a like manner. The standards
should be cut to the proper length
for the person carrying the suitcase.&mdash;Contributed

<h3>
Construction
</h3>

<p>
The first part to make is the main
frame A which is constructed of the
four bamboo poles. They are made
into a rectangular frame with crossbars
marked B cut to the right length
from the 12-ft. piece of spruce, 1/2&nbsp;in.
by 1&nbsp;in. The bars C and D are of oak
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>[117]</a></span>
cut from the 6-ft. piece, 5/8&nbsp;in. by 1-1/4&nbsp;in.
All of these crossbars are fastened together
in rectangular form by means
of stove bolts. The bamboo poles are
then bolted to the inner corners of the
frames with 3/16-in. bolts. Place the
bolts through the bamboo close to a
joint to prevent splitting. The frame is
then rigidly trussed by diagonal wires
marked E crossing all rectangles. The
wire used for trussing all the parts
throughout the glider is piano wire, 16
gauge. The arm pieces are bolted to
the sides of the rectangular frames beneath
the wings.

  <p>Wing Bar</p>
</div>

<p>
The framework of the main wings or
planes should be put together by bolting
the cross struts F at regular intervals
on the under side of the main spars
G. Brace the frame diagonally with
the piano wire. The ribs are nailed to
the main spars by using 1-in. brads.
The ribs are spaced 1&nbsp;ft. apart, and
curved so that the highest part will be
5&nbsp;in. from the horizontal. Each rib extends
15&nbsp;in. back of the rear spar. The
rudder is made in the same manner.
</p>

<p>
The vertical rudder is made to fold.
A small pocket arrangement H is made
from which the rigs of the vertical
rudder diverge.
</p>

<p>
The covering of the wings and rudders
should be a good quality of muslin
or some light aeronautical goods.
The cloth should be tacked to the front
spar, to the ribs, and then sewn to a
wire which connects the ends of the ribs.
</p>

<p>
Construct the triangular arrangement
marked J to which the wings are
braced. The wing bar supports are
shown in the illustration. The bottom
wires are braced to the crossbar K
shown in the front elevation.
</p>

<p>
The bracing wires are all fastened to
a snaphook which can be snapped into
the rings at the places marked L. This
method will allow one quickly to assemble
or take apart the plane and
store it in a small place. The vertical
rudder should be braced from each rib
to the front spar of the horizontal rudder
and then braced by the wires M
to hold the rudder from falling back.
The rudder is then braced to the main
frame and the main frame is braced by
the wires N to the wings. This will
hold the plane rigid. Use snaphooks
and eyebolts wherever possible so that
the plane can be quickly assembled.
</p>


<h3>
Assembling
</h3>

<p>
The triangular arrangement J is
bolted to the wings and the top wires
put in place. The wings are then put
on the main frame and bolted to the
bars marked C and D, after which the
bottom wires are fixed in place.
</p>


<h3>
Gliding
</h3>

<p>
Take the glider to the top of a hill,
step into the center of the main frame
just a little back of the center of the
wings. Put your arms around the arm
pieces, face the wind and run a few
steps. You will be lifted off the ground
and carried down the slope. The balancing
is done by shifting the legs.
The glides should be short at first, but
by daily practice, and, as the operator
gains skill, glides can be made up to a
length of several hundred feet. Do not
attempt to fly in a wind having a velocity
of more than 15 miles an hour.

A Laboratory Gas Generator
</h2>


<p>
The sketch illustrates a gas generator
designed for laboratories where
gases are needed in large quantities
and frequently. The shelf holding the
large inverted bottle is of thick wood,
and to reinforce the whole apparatus,
a 1-in. copper strip is placed around
the bottle tightly and fastened with
screws turned into the woodwork.
The shelf above is attached last, and
upon it rests the bottle of commercial
acid required in the gas generation.
The pump shown is for use in starting
the siphon.

  <p>Gas Generator of Large Capacity That will Work
Automatically as the Gas is Removed</p>
</div>

<p>
The large bottle used as a generator
may be either a 3 or 5-gal. size, and
after it is placed in the position shown,
a sufficient amount of the solid reagent
needed in gas generating is placed in
the mouth before the exit tube, leading
away below, is fixed in position. If
sulphureted hydrogen is required, ferrous
sulphide is used; if hydrogen is
required, zinc is placed within; and to
make a carbon dioxide, marble, or its
equivalent, is inserted. Whatever gas
is required, a sufficient quantity of the
solid material is put in to last for some
time in order not to disturb the fastenings.
</p>

<p>
When all is ready, the pump is used
gently to start the acid over the siphon
and into the generator from below.
The gas generated by the action of the
acid on the solid soon fills the bottle.
The screw clamp on the exit tube is
loosened and the gas passes into the
bottle of water and charges it, in the
case when sulphureted hydrogen is required.
In the other cases, when sufficient
gas has been generated, the
screw clamp is tightened, and the gas
soon attains considerable pressure
which forces the acid back out of the
generator and into the acid bottle
above. The whole apparatus now
comes to an equilibrium, and the gas
in the generator is ready for another
use.&mdash;Contributed by W. M. Mills,

<p>
Procure a strip of sheet metal, 6&nbsp;in.
long, 1&nbsp;in. wide, or as wide as the armature
core is long, and 3/32&nbsp;in. thick. Bend
this into a U-shape, as shown, and file
each end similar to the barb on a fishhook.
Drill two holes for a bolt to pass
through the sheet-metal ends. Fasten
a screw or bolt in the center of the
bend, to be used for gripping in a chuck
or polishing head. Core segments can
be quickly wound with this device.&mdash;Contributed

Laboratory Force Filter

The sketch represents a force filter

the side tube by suction, which in turn
draws the air in a steady stream
through the Wolff bottles. The tubes
may be attached to a filter inserted in a
filter bottle and filtering thus greatly
facilitated. The connection to the faucet
can be made, as shown in the detailed
sketch, out of a long cork, by
boring a hole large enough to fit the
faucet through the cork and another
slanting hole, joining the central hole,
on the side for a pipe or tube. At the
lower end of the cork a tube is also fitted,
which may be drawn out to increase
the suction. The inclined tube
should be slightly bent at the lower
end.&mdash;Contributed by W. M. Mills,

and partly filled with alcohol, the remaining
space being exhausted of air.
The glass tube is secured to a hanger
which is pivoted to the bottom of the vessel.
</p>

<p>
After a quantity of water has been
poured into the vessel and the device
allowed to stand undisturbed for a few
minutes, the tube will begin to move
with an oscillating motion. Some of
the water in the vessel has been conducted
by means of the wicks C to the
bent plaster cups, from the surface of
which it evaporates, thus absorbing latent
heat and producing a lower temperature
in the cups than that of the
surrounding atmosphere. The bulb
in contact with the cup thus acquires
a lower temperature than the one at
the end D, which will result in condensation
of the alcohol vapor within the
former. The pressure of the vapor in
the lower bulb will then force the alcohol
up the inclined tube into the higher
bulb, the evaporation in the lower
bulb maintaining the pressure therein.
</p>

<p>
When a sufficient quantity of alcohol
has been forced into the upper
bulb, it will descend, and thus elevate
the other bulb into its cup. The phenomena
just described will be repeated
in this bulb and the oscillation will

A Mirror an Aid in Rowing a Boat
</h2>


<p>
The young oarsman is apt to experience
difficulty in keeping a straight
course until he has had some practice.
Rowing a boat in a narrow channel
calls for considerable skill to hold a
course in mid-stream. A variation of
force in pulling the oars almost instantly
results in the rowboat making
a landfall on one or the other of the
banks.

The skilled oarsman does not need
an appliance that the beginner might
welcome. With the aid of a mirror
conveniently supported at a suitable
angle and height before the oarsman's

boats may be seen with distinctness.
The mirror may be set directly

Developing Tray Made of a Tin Can
</h2>


<p>
Obtain a tomato or other can, 5 or 6&nbsp;in. long and 4&nbsp;in. in diameter, which
should be secured before it has been
opened, says Camera Craft. Cut both
ends exactly half way around, keeping
close to the edge, as shown in the first
sketch, and slit it lengthwise to open
the side. Trim off the end pieces to
within 1&nbsp;in. of the center and cut off
the surplus tin of the sides of the can,
leaving enough to bend over and form
the ends of the tank as shown in the
second sketch.

make the tank solid and heavy. Bend
the sides of the can over the edges of
the two uprights and tack them firmly
to the sides, bending the tin so as to
have a rounded surface that will not
scratch the films. The ends of the can
are bent over sharply to form the sides
of the tank. Procure a round wood
stick, the length of the tank, place in
position, and fasten with a screw
through the tin at both ends. Give the
whole tank two coats of black asphaltum

<h2>
Illuminating an Outside Thermometer
</h2>


<p>
During the season of furnace fires
the thermometer outside the north
window becomes of added interest and
usefulness in helping one to judge the
proper draft adjustments of the furnace
for the
night. A pocket
electric flashlamp
is convenient
for examining
the thermometer
after
dark, but it is not
always at hand,
matches are dangerous
when
lace curtains are
at the window,
and besides, the reflection from the
glass of both matches and flashlamp
on the inside makes it very difficult
to read the thermometer.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img122'>
  <img src='images/img122.png' alt='img122' title='img122' />
</div>

<p>
To avoid these difficulties I attached
to my thermometer the device shown
herewith, which consists of a miniature
battery lamp placed at the back of the
translucent-glass thermometer and operated
by a battery within the house,
the light being turned on by an ordinary
push button placed conveniently
inside of the window.
</p>

<p>
A strip of brass, A, 3/8&nbsp;in. wide by 1/16&nbsp;in. thick, was riveted (soldering will
do) to the lower support of the thermometer.
The free end of this brass
strip was bent around a disk of hardwood,
B, and fastened to it by three or
four small screws in such a manner
that the disk made a circular platform
just behind the thermometer scale.
This disk was slightly larger than the
mouth of a small, thin tumbler. On
the upper surface of this disk was fastened
with shellac and small nails close
to the periphery, a disk of cork, 1/4&nbsp;in.
thick, this cork disk being a close fit
for the mouth of the tumbler. A
miniature porcelain electric-lamp
socket was fastened with screws
on the cork of the base. Wires
were then run from the lamp
socket through the cork and wood
disks and the whole painted with
melted paraffin to close all apertures
and keep out moisture. Good rubber-covered
electric-light wire will do
nicely for the wiring outside the house,
although, if it can be obtained, a piece
of lead-covered paired wire is preferable.
These wires must be only long
enough to reach inside the house,
where they may be joined to the ordinary
sort of wire used in electric-bell
work for connecting with push button
and battery.
</p>

<p>
A 4-volt lamp of about 2 cp. will be
sufficient to illuminate the thermometer
and allow the scale and mercury column
to be distinctly seen. It may be
found necessary to make some adjustment
by bending the brass strip in
order to bring the lamp centrally behind
the scale and at the proper
height to give the best lighting on the
range of from 10 to 40&nbsp;deg. Over the
lamp is placed the tumbler for protection
from the weather, and, if desired,
half of the tumbler may be painted as
a reflector on the inside with white
enamel paint, although, in practice, I
have not found this necessary.
</p>

<p>
Within the house the push button
should be placed at the window where
it can be most conveniently reached
when viewing the thermometer, and
connections may be made to the battery
regularly used for ringing the
house bells, or to a separate battery of,
say, 4 dry cells, placed in some location,
as a closet, near the thermometer.&mdash;Contributed

How to Make an Automobile Robe
</h2>


<p>
When driving an automobile in cold
weather, it is impossible to have a
robe come down over the feet without
being in the way so that it is inconvenient
in working the pedals. Procure
a common heavy robe and cut two
holes in it about 5&nbsp;in. from the bottom
just large enough for the toe of the
shoes to slip through and bind the
edges with cloth or fur. The 5&nbsp;in. of
robe below the holes should come back
under the feet so that no wind can enter.
Make the holes far enough apart
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>[123]</a></span>
so that both outside pedals can be
reached easily and you will have no

with the use of overshoes, will insure
comfort in driving a car.&mdash;Contributed

<p>
It is very hard to locate an electric-light
globe in a dark room. Anyone

When it becomes too cold for the

outdoors, he generally lays aside his
camera and thinks no more about it
until the coming of another spring or
summer. While some winter scenes
would make up an interesting part of
anyone's collection, it is not always
pleasant to go out to take them.
</p>

<p>
Some derive pleasure from making
groups and portraits, but this is very
difficult, if the room is not well
lighted. Overhead light is the best
for this work and few residences are
constructed to furnish this kind of light.

as shown,
with only
two of the
holes engaging
in one

clamp with the handle. This will allow
about 1/2&nbsp;in. of the blade to project at

Without the proper tools and material,

it quite difficult to construct a small
armature for a battery motor that will
run true, without vibration and have

gears or pinions, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1,
make excellent cores for armatures on
small motors. A gear of any number
of teeth can be used for an armature
with a smaller number of coils by cutting
out a certain number of teeth.
For example, a gear with 12 teeth will
take 12 coils, but if every other tooth
is cut out, it will take only 6 coils, etc.
The teeth can be easily chipped out
with a cold chisel.

Larger armatures can be made from
gears with spokes, the spokes being

The gear, when wound, can be mounted
on a hub made of empty thread spools.
The spool can be turned at one end to
insert it in the armature, and if too
long, one end will serve for the core of
the commutator, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2.
This combination will make a neat,
efficient little armature, which will run
quite free from vibration. Only simple
tools, such as a hammer, cold
chisel, file, jackknife and a vise, are
required.&mdash;Contributed by R. J. Nault, Hartford, Conn.

Ice Creeper for Shoe Heels

Many persons, young and old, have
falls every winter on the ice or snow
which can be avoided if their shoes
are fitted with ice creepers. A very
efficient device of this kind, which any
boy can make at home in a short time,
is shown in the sketch. These ice
creepers need not be removed from
the shoes or boots until the winter is
past, for they may be worn indoors
without injuring the finest floor.
</p>

<p>
The two plates A may be made
from either iron or steel&mdash;preferably

the steel to a cherry red and then
letting it cool slowly. It may then
be sawn with a hacksaw, cut with a
cold chisel, or filed into plates of the
proper shape, as shown. The teeth are
filed to points. The two L-shaped
slots are made by drilling 3/16-in. holes
through the plates, and then sawing,
filing or chiseling out the metal between
the holes. The projections at
the ends are then bent out at right
angles with heavy pliers or the claws
of a hammer, and finally the plates
bent to fit the curve of the heel.

<p>
One of the most distressing sides of

<p>
A large, strongly made wooden box&mdash;one
of tin is better&mdash;will be necessary,
together with a sufficient amount
of sand to fill it. If possible, the sand
should be of the kind known as "silver
sand," which is very fine. The best
that can be procured will be found far
from clean, and it must, therefore, be
thoroughly washed. The sand should
be poured into a bowl of clean water.
Much of the dirt will float on the surface.
This is skimmed off and thrown
away, and clean water added. The
sand should be washed in this manner
at least a dozen times, or until nothing
remains but pure white grains of sand.
The clean sand is spread out to dry on
a cloth in a thin layer. When thoroughly
dry, it should be placed in a
heavy earthenware vessel and further
dried in a hot oven. Allow it to remain
in the oven for some time until
it is completely warmed through so

  <p>...and Pouring the Dry Sand around Them</p>
</div>

<p>
Obtain a piece of heavy cardboard
and cut it to fit easily in the bottom
of the box. Through the bottom of
the cardboard insert a number of steel
pins, one for each of the flowers to be
preserved. Take the dry blossoms and
press the stalk of each on a steel pin
so that it is held in an upright position.
When the cardboard is thus filled,
place it in the box.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img127b'>

  <p>The Dried Flowers</p>
</div>

<p>
The warm sand is put in a bag or
some other receptacle from which it
can be easily poured. Pour the sand
into the box gently, allowing it to
trickle slowly in so that it spreads
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>[128]</a></span>
evenly. Keep on pouring sand until
the heads of the flowers are reached,
taking care that all of them stand in a
vertical position. The utmost care
must be taken, when the heads are
reached, to see that all the petals are in
their right order. Remember that any
crumpled flowers will be pressed into
any position they may assume by the
weight of the sand. When the box is
filled it should be covered and set
aside in a dry place.
</p>

<p>
The box should be allowed to stand
at least 48 hours. After the first day,
if only a small amount of sand has
been used, the material may have
cooled off to some extent, and the box
must be set in a moderately heated
oven for a short time, but no great
amount of warmth is advisable. After
48 hours the box may be uncovered
and the sand carefully poured off. As
the flowers are now in a very brittle
condition, any rough handling will
cause serious damage. When all the
sand has been emptied, the cardboard
should be removed from the box and
each blossom taken from its pin. In
the case of succulent specimens, the
stems will have shrunk considerably,
but the thinner petals will be in an almost
natural condition. The colors
will be bright and attractive. Some
tints will have kept better than others,
but most of the results will be surprisingly
good. Whatever state the flowers
are in when they are taken from
the box, if the drying process has been
thorough, they will keep almost indefinitely.
</p>

<p>
Flowers preserved in this manner
are admirable for the decoration of
homes. If they are exposed to light,
care should be taken to see that the direct
sunshine does not strike them, as
it will fade the colors. Sprigs with
leaves attached may be dried in this
way, but it has been found that much
of the intensity of the green is lost in
the process.

<h2>
Reading Pulse Beats with the Sun's Rays
</h2>


<p>
The pulse beats may be counted by
this unusual method. On a clear day,
when the sun is shining brightly,
darken a room and select one window
toward the sunlight, which should be
prepared as follows: Draw the curtain
part way down and cover the rest of
the window with a heavy cardboard.
Cut a small hole in the cardboard to
admit a beam of light. Set a bowl of
water on a table in the path of the
beam so as to deflect it to the ceiling
as shown by the dotted lines in the sketch.

<p>
It is now a simple matter to show

against the edge of the bowl as shown,
and the beam of light directed to the
ceiling will record every beat of the
pulse by short, abrupt movements.

<h2>
Artistic Wood Turning
</h2>


<p>
Some very odd and beautiful effects
can be obtained in lathe work by making
up the stock from several pieces of
various kinds of wood glued together.
The pieces can be arranged in many
pleasing combinations, and if good
joints are made and a good quality of
glue used, the built-up stock is just as
durable as a solid piece.
</p>

<p>
Candlesticks turned from built-up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>[129]</a></span>
stock are especially attractive, parts of
the various light and dark woods appearing
here and there in all manner of
odd shapes and proportions. If the
stock is placed off center in the lathe,
a still greater variety of effects will
be produced.
</p>

<p>
The application of a potassium-bichromate
solution to the finished work
turns each piece a different color. This
solution can be made in any depth of
color by varying the amounts of potassium
salt and water. Maple or birch
treated with this solution are colored
to a rich Osage orange which cannot
be surpassed in beauty. Mahogany is
turned a deep reddish brown, and walnut
is darkened a great deal. The solution
is applied as evenly as possible
with a camel's-hair brush while the
wood is turning in the lathe. The grain
of the wood is somewhat roughened
by this process, but it can be dressed
down again with very fine sandpaper.

exception of the last, should be sandpapered
slightly. Powdered pumice
stone on a cloth held in the palm of
the hand can be used to apply a beautiful
luster. Some suggestions as to the
manner of combining various woods,

<p>
A simple variable condenser for receiving

Each clip on the switch was
made of ribbon brass or copper in the
shape shown at A, the first one from
the joint of the knife switch being
the longest and each succeeding one
shorter. The handle was taken from
a single-pole switch. The case was
made of oak and varnished and the
condenser was made of tinfoil and thin
sheets of mica, 2 by 3&nbsp;in. in size. After
placing the condenser in the case, hot
paraffin was poured around it.

<h2>
A Pushmobile Race
</h2>


<p>
Pending the time set for a 500-mile
international automobile race that was
scheduled to take place several weeks
later, a number of boys in the sixth and
seventh grades of a public school were
enthusiastic over the idea of building
for themselves, in
the school shops,
pushmobiles and
having a race
meet similar to
the large one advertised.

  <p>The Cars Winning the First, Second and Third Prizes
Respectively, the "Hoosier" being Penalized
10 Yards at the Starting Tape for Having
Larger and Better-Grade Wheels</p>
</div>

<p>
The pushmobiles were made and the
race run as an opening feature of a
field meet held in the city. The course
was about a half mile long, and was
chosen to give the contestants plenty
of curves, a part of the run being over
brick streets and the final quarter on
the regular track where the field meet
was held.
</p>

<p>
Interest was added to the event by
petitioning the mayor of the city for
a permit to run the race, and the Boy
Scouts patrolled the route, while the
city policemen cleared the streets, and
during the race all traffic was halted.
</p>

<p>
Two of the requirements for entering
the race were that the car had to be
made in the school shops and that it
must have a certain kind of a wheel,
which in this case was one condemned
by a local factory, thus making the
wheels and wheel base of all cars alike.
Two boys to a car constituted a racing
team, and during the race they
could exchange positions at their pleasure.
The necessity of "nursing" their
cars down the steep grades and around
difficult corners developed into an important
factor. All cars were
named and numbered.
</p>

<p>
The car that finished first was
disqualified for the
reason that it took
on a fresh pusher
along the course.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>[131]</a></span>
The cars were constructed under the
supervision of the regular shop instructor,
and a drawing was furnished
each boy making a car. The design of
the hood and the arrangement of the
seat and steering gear was left for each
boy to settle as he desired. The matter
of expense was watched closely by
each one. Most of the hoods and
seats were constructed of empty dry-goods boxes.
</p>

  </a>
  <p>The Entire Chassis was Made of Cypress Wood, All Cars
of the Same Length and Width, the Hoods and Seats Being the Only Parts
Optional in Size and Shape for the Builder</p>
</div>

<p>
With the aid of the sketch any boy
can make a car as strong as the
"Peugeot" that won the race.
The side rails of the main
frame were made of cypress,
58&nbsp;in. long and 2&nbsp;in. square.
The location of the crossbars A and B
is very important, as they give rigidity
to the frame and reinforce the two
bolsters C and D. The size of the
hood and the location of the seat determine
where they should be set into
the rail, after which they are fastened
with large wood screws. The three
bolsters C, D, and E are cut from regular
2 by 4-in. stock. Be careful to
get a uniform distance between the
rails when they are framed together.
If desired, the dimensions can be increased,
but do not reduce them, as
this will narrow the tread too much.
The bolt connecting the bolsters C and
E is a common carriage bolt, 5&nbsp;in. long
and 1/2&nbsp;in. in diameter. A washer is
placed between the pieces C and E, to
make the turning easy.
</p>

<p>
Two pieces of 1/2-in. soft-steel rod
were used for the axles, a hole being
drilled near each end for a cotter, to
hold the wheels in place, and also holes
through the diameter between the
wheels, for 1-1/2-in. screws to fasten the
axles to the bolsters.
</p>

<p>
The steering wheel is constructed of
a broom handle with a small wheel
fastened to its upper end, and the lower
end supported by a crossbar,
F, and the back end of the
hood. Before fastening
the crossbar F
in place, adjust
the steering
wheel to the
proper height for
the seat; then it is
fastened with nails driven
through the sides of the hood.
</p>

<p>
The construction of the steering
device is very simple. The crossarm
G is a piece of timber, 7&nbsp;in. long, 2&nbsp;in.
wide and 1&nbsp;in. thick, rounded on the
ends and provided with a large screw
eye near each end on the under side to
which are fastened the ends of two
small-linked chains. The chains are
then crossed and fastened to the bottom
bolster in front and as near the
wheels as practical. The connection is
made with a screw eye similar to the
one used in the crossarm. Another
type of steering device may be made
by building on the rod a 5-in. drum
which takes the place of the steering
arm. It is a more positive appliance,
but is somewhat harder to make and adjust.
</p>

<p>
The making of the hood and the seat
completes the car. Decide upon the
shape and size of the hood, but, in any
case and irrespective of the size, it will
require a front and back end. These
are made first and then secured at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>[132]</a></span>
proper distance apart with two side
rails. These two ends are nailed on the
ends of the connecting rails. It is then
well to fasten the hood skeleton to the
car frame and cover it after the steering
device is in place.
</p>

<p>
The seat bottom is cut the shape
desired, and fastened to the rear bolster
and crosspiece, first placing a piece of
the proper thickness under the front
edge, to give it the desired slant backward.
The back curved part can be
formed of a piece of sheet metal and
lined on the inside with wood pieces,
or with cloth or leather, padded to resemble
the regular cushion.

a number of rectangles corresponding
to the number of pencil holders
desired. With a sharp chisel, cut
through the metal on three sides of
each rectangle, leaving one of the
short sides untouched. The loose laps
can then be bent to a shape suited to
hold a pencil. The rack can be
fastened in place with nails or screws
through holes pierced at each end.&mdash;Contributed

A very good method of growing individual
strawberry plants that will

a covering constructed from a
board 10&nbsp;in. square with a 3-in. hole
bored in the center. This covering
is placed over the plant, as shown in
the sketch, to keep down weeds, retain
moisture, and to make a base for the
ripening berries. A shower cannot
spatter dirt and sand on the growing
fruit. The rays of the sun beating
on the surface of the board will aid in
the ripening.

Drill a small hole in the screw as

<p>
The place for the seat is cut out of
each sidepiece, as shown by the
notches at D, which are 2&nbsp;ft. from the
rear ends. Two strips of wood, E, 1/2&nbsp;in. thick, 4&nbsp;in. wide, and 22&nbsp;in. long,
are fastened with nails to the rear ends
of the sides, as shown. The rear wheel
is a bicycle wheel, which can be taken
from an old bicycle, or a wheel may
be purchased cheaply at a bicycle store.
It is held in place with two pieces of
strap iron, F, shaped similar to the
rear forks on a bicycle, and each piece
is bolted to a block of wood 3&nbsp;in. thick,
4&nbsp;in. wide, and 6&nbsp;in. long, which is
fastened to the sidepiece with the same
bolts that hold the strap iron in place.
The blocks are located 20&nbsp;in. from the
rear ends of the sidepieces.

How to Make a Humidor
</h2>


<p>
The humidor is an ideal gift for any
person who smokes. The wood for
making one, as shown in the illustration,
may be of Spanish cedar, mahogany,
or quartered oak, as the builder
desires. The box and cover are made
and glued together in one piece, then
the cover is sawed off to insure a perfect
fit. A strong corner connection is
shown at A. A piece of a strawberry
box or peach basket makes a good key
to glue in the grooves. Care must be
taken to run the grain with the width
and not with the length of the strip.

  <p>The Amount of Moisture within the Box is Shown
on the Dial in the Cover</p>
</div>

<p>
Finish the outside of the box with
two coats of the desired stain, then
cover with a coat of wax, shellac, or
varnish. The inside should be finished
with one coat of white lead and two or
three coats of white enamel, to make
the wood impervious to moisture.
</p>

<p>
In the center of the cover top is set
a piece of glass and to the under side
of the latter a hygrometer is attached
with a little glue. This instrument
tells the relative humidity, or the
amount of moisture, in the air within.
The moisture may be regulated by adding
a few drops of water, as needed, to
a piece of ordinary blotting paper
placed on the inside.&mdash;Contributed by

<h2>
Telephoto Attachment for a Hand Camera
</h2>


<p>
It is not necessary to purchase an
expensive telephoto lens for a box or
hand camera if the owner has a pair of
opera or field glasses. First focus the
glasses on the distant object to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>[137]</a></span>
photographed and then set the camera.
One of the glasses is placed directly
in line with and in front of the camera
lens, as shown in the sketch. If the
camera is of the focusing type, it is
focused in the ordinary manner. Box
and other cameras are set as usual.

  <p>A Field Glass Placed in Front of a Camera Lens
will Increase the Diameter of the Photograph</p>
</div>

<p>
The glasses should be well supported
in front of the camera lens, as any
slight move will be quite perceptible
on the ground glass. As the light rays
are largely reduced in passing through
the field glass and camera lens, it is
necessary to give a much longer exposure.
This can only be determined
by trying it out, as lenses have different
speeds.&mdash;Contributed by Charles

<h2>
A Turn Feeding Table for Birds
</h2>


<p>
Never in the past has the public at
large taken so great an interest in protecting
and furthering the well-being
of birds as at present. In addition to
protective legislation, clubs everywhere
are organizing to promote bird
life and many citizens, old and young,
are making bird houses and feeding tables.
</p>

<p>
One of the best forms of feeding
tables which I have ever seen is shown
in the sketch. It possesses a great
advantage over the average table in
being turned automatically, whirling
about by the action of the winds and
always keeping its open front on the
lee or protected quarter. This is a
good feature especially in the fall and
winter, the very time when birds need
and seek protection from storms and
cold winds.
</p>

<p>
To make such a feed table almost
any kind of boards can be utilized.
The shelter may be of any shape or
size to suit the tastes of the maker,
but one constructed to the dimensions
given will be found to work well in
most localities. Along the center of
the roof is attached a wing, A, which
is an active aid in causing the wind
to keep the open front turned away.
The shelter turns upon a wood or iron
rod which passes from the end of a
post up through the central bottom
and central roof of the structure. If
wood is used for the rod, it should
be about 1&nbsp;in. in diameter and of hard
stock. An iron rod may be somewhat
smaller. Keep the holes well greased.

An old granite kettle or tin pail with
the bottom cut out and three 8-penny

rivets, as shown at A, makes as good
a sack holder as one could desire. A
chain attached to the handle makes it
conveniently adjustable to the proper
height for the sack.

<p>
The time to give a patient the next
dose of medicine can be set on the indicator,
as shown in the sketch, and
retained without
fear of its being
changed until
the dose is again
given. The indicator
consists
of a strip of
paper which will
reach around the
bottle neck and
is divided into 24
equal parts representing hours
and half hours. The paper is then
pasted to the bottle neck. An ordinary
pin is then pushed into the cork as
shown. After a dose of medicine is
given to the patient the cork is replaced
so that the head of the pin will
indicate the time for the next dose.
By this method, an accidental shifting
of the indicator is almost impossible.

<h2>
A Washtub Stand
</h2>


<p>
Usually two old chairs or an old box
makes the stand for the washtub, and
these are not always the right height.
A stand, like that shown in the illustration
and having the proper height
for the one who does the washing, can
be easily made of 2 by 4-in. material
and a few boards. As it is shown, the
wringer is fastened on top of the back
and may remain there all the time, it
being out of the way, always in its
proper place, and held very firmly.

fastened on the back of the stand, connected
with two hinges and supported
by a leg hinged to the bracket, the
lower end of the leg resting on the
floor back of the stand.
</p>

<p>
A small drawer may also be provided
in the front, in which to put
away the soap and brushes, and the
wash boiler can be set underneath.
When one is through washing, the
bracket at the back is let down, the
washstand set up against the wall out
of the way, and everything is then in
its place, ready for the next wash day.&mdash;Contributed

The sketch shows how a very cheap
and serviceable leather punch can be
made of an old pipe nipple.
Pieces of pipe of almost
any size can be
found around a shop,
and it is, therefore, usually
possible to quickly
make a punch of the required
size. The cutter
end can be ground very
thin to prevent an over-cut,
while a small slot
cut a little above it will
allow the removal of the
leather slugs. For its
purpose, this homemade tool is all that
can be desired in cheapness and utility.

<h2>
To Prevent Oilcloth from Cracking
</h2>


<p>
A good method to prevent oilcloth
from cracking, when it is used on shop
tables or counters, is to first cut a paper
cover for the table on which to
place the oilcloth and prepare it as follows:
The paper should be well oiled
with common machine oil and placed
smoothly on the table to be covered.
The oilcloth is then smoothed out on
top of the paper and stretched tightly.
The oiled paper tends to keep the under
side of the cloth moist, which prevents
cracking. The cloth wears much
longer because the paper acts as a pad.

<h2>
How to Make a Flymobile<br />
By Edward Sieja
</h2>


<p>
The boy owning a pushmobile, or
even a power-driven auto car, is often
very much disappointed because motion
soon stops when the power is not
applied. The car illustrated is of a little
different type, being equipped with
a flywheel that will propel the car and
carry the rider a considerable distance
after stopping the pedaling. The flywheel
also aids the operator, as it will
steady the motion and help him over a
rough place or a bump in the road.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img139b'>

timbers. The pieces A are 6&nbsp;ft. 4&nbsp;in.
long, and the end crosspieces B, 24&nbsp;in.
long. These are jointed, glued and
screwed together, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1.
The frame that supports the driving
parts consists of a piece, C, 6&nbsp;ft. 2&nbsp;in.
long, and a piece D, 2&nbsp;ft. 11&nbsp;in. long.
These are fitted in the main frame and
securely fastened to the end crosspieces
B. Two other crosspieces, E and
F, are used to strengthen the driving-parts frame.

<p>
The entire hanger G, with its bearings,
cranks and pedals, can be procured
from a discarded bicycle and fastened
to the piece C; the barrel holding
the bearings being snugly fitted into a
hole bored in the piece with an expansive
bit. The location will depend on
the builder and should be marked as
follows: Place the hanger on top of the
piece C, then put a box or board on
the frame where the seat is to be and
set the hanger where it will be in a
comfortable position for pedaling.
Mark this location and bore the hole.

<p>
The transmission H consists of a
bicycle coaster-brake hub, shown in
detail in Fig.&nbsp;2. A split pulley, J, 6&nbsp;in.
in diameter, is bored out to fit over the
center of the hub between the spoke
flanges. The halves of the pulley are
then clamped on the hub with two
bolts, run through the holes in opposite
directions. Their heads and nuts are
let into countersunk holes so that no
part will extend above the surface of
the pulley. The supports for the hub
axle consist of two pieces of bar iron,
4&nbsp;in. long, drilled to admit the axle
ends, and screws for fastening them to
the frame pieces C and D. This construction
is clearly shown in Fig.&nbsp;2.
</p>

<p>
The arrangement of the coaster-brake
hub produces the same effect as
a coaster brake on a bicycle. The one
propelling the flymobile may stop the
foot-power work without interfering
with the travel of the machine, and, besides,
a little back pressure on the pedals
will apply the brake in the same manner.
</p>

<p>
The flywheel K should be about 18&nbsp;in. in diameter with a 2-in. rim, or face.
Such a wheel can be purchased cheaply
from any junk dealer. The flywheel is
set on a shaft, turning between the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>[140]</a></span>
pieces C and D and back of the coaster-brake
wheel H. Two pulleys, L,
about 3&nbsp;in. in diameter, are fastened to
turn with the flywheel on the shaft and
are fitted with flanges to separate the
belts. The ends of the shaft should
run in good bearings, well oiled.
</p>

  <p>(Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
Another pulley, M, 6&nbsp;in. in diameter,
is made of wood and fastened to the
rear axle. An idler wheel, shown in
Fig.&nbsp;3, is constructed of a small pulley,
or a large spool, attached to an L-shaped
piece of metal, which in turn
is fastened on the end of a shaft controlled
by the lever N. The function
of this idler is to tighten up the belt or
release it, thus changing the speed in
the same manner as on a motorcycle.
</p>

<p>
The elevation of the flymobile is given
in Fig.&nbsp;4, which shows the arrangement
of the belting. The size of the
pulleys on the flywheel shaft causes it
to turn rapidly, and, for this reason, the
weight of the wheel will run the car a
considerable distance when the coaster
hub is released.

The rear axle revolves in bearings,
half of which is recessed in the under
edges of the pieces A while the other
half is fastened to a block, screwed on
over the axle. A simple brake is made
as shown in Fig.&nbsp;5. Two metal pieces,
O, preferably brass, are shaped to fit
over the shaft with extending ends for
fastening them to the pieces P and Q,
as shown. These pieces are hinged
with strap iron, R, at one end, the other
end of the piece P being fastened to
the crosspiece F, Fig.&nbsp;1, of the main
frame. The lower piece Q is worked
by the lever S and side bars, T. A
small spring, U, keeps the ends of the
pieces apart and allows the free turning
of the axle until the brake lever is
drawn. The lever S is connected by a
long bar to the hand lever V.

The steering apparatus W, Figs. 1
and 4, is constructed of a piece of gas
pipe, 3&nbsp;ft. 4&nbsp;in. long, with a wheel at
one end and a cord, X, at the other.
The center part of the cord is wound
several times around the pipe and the
ends are passed through screweyes in
the main frame pieces A and attached
to the front axle, which is pivoted in
the center under the block Y. The
lower end of the pipe turns in a hole
bored slanting in the block. A turn of
the steering wheel causes one end of
the cord to wind and the other to unwind,
which turns the axle on the center
pivot.
</p>

<p>
The wheels are bicycle wheels, and
the ends of the front axle are turned to
receive the cones and nuts, instead of
using the regular hub axles. The ends
of the rear axle are turned to closely fit
the hubs after the ball cups have been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>[141]</a></span>
removed. A large washer and nut
clamp each wheel to the axle so that
it will turn with it.
</p>

<p>
The body can be made up as desired,
from sheet metal, wood, or cloth
stretched over ribs of wood, and
painted in the manner of an automobile.
A tank and tires can be placed on
the back to add to the appearance.
Fenders and a running board can be
attached to the main frame.
</p>

<p>
With the addition of some crosspieces
in the main frame at the front
and a motorcycle engine fastened to
them so that the driving sprocket will
be in line with the sprocket on the
coaster hub, the builder will have a real cyclecar.

  <p>...and the False-Die pattern (Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
The trick is performed as follows:
Procure a hat from some one in the
audience and place in it the die with
the tin false die covering three sides
of the block, at the same time telling
the audience that the block will be
caused to pass from the hat into the
box, the latter being placed some distance
away. Inform the audience that
it would be more difficult for the die
to pass from the box into the hat. Remove
the tin piece from the hat and
leave the die, holding the surfaces of
the false die toward the audience.
This will give the impression that the
die has been removed. Set the hat on
the table above the level of the eyes
of the audience. With the back of the
box toward the audience, open one
top door and insert the tin piece in
the right-hand compartment so that
one side touches the back, another the
side and the other the bottom of the
box. Close the door and open the two
doors of the opposite compartment
which, when shown, will appear to be
empty. Tilt the box to this side and
open the doors of the side opposite to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>[142]</a></span>
the one just opened, which, of course,
will be empty. This should be done
several times until some one asks that
all doors be opened at the same time.
After a few more reversals and openings
as given, open all doors and show
it empty, then take the die from the
hat.&mdash;Contributed by Harold L. Groesbeck,

<h2>
Homemade Pantograph
</h2>


<p>
The pantograph consists of four
pieces of wood, the dimensions depending
somewhat on the size of the
work to be drawn. A convenient size
for ordinary drawing and enlarging is
constructed of four pieces of hardwood,
preferably maple, 3/16&nbsp;in. thick
and 5/8&nbsp;in. wide, two of them 20-3/4&nbsp;in.
in length and the other two, 18-3/4&nbsp;in.
long. These are planed and sandpapered
and the ends cut round.

  </a>
  <p>A Picture can be Enlarged or Reduced by Setting
the Screweyes in the Holes Designated</p>
</div>

<p>
All four pieces are laid flat on a level
board or bench top with their edges together
so that the edges of the two
longer pieces make right angles with
a line drawn tangent to their ends.
One end of one short piece is placed
flush with the lower ends of the two
long pieces, and one end of the other
short piece flush with the upper ends,
as shown. They should be clamped
down solidly to keep them from moving
while laying off the divisions.
Light lines are drawn across their
faces as designated by the dimensions.
On these lines and exactly in the
center of the pieces make small marks
with a pencil point. Through the
pieces A and B holes are drilled to
snugly receive the body of a small
screweye. The other two pieces are
drilled with a smaller drill so that the
threads of the screweye will take hold
in the wood.
</p>

<p>
The end C of the piece A has a
metal stand made of brass as shown at
D. This is fastened to the end of the
wood with a small bolt. The hole
should be a snug fit over the body of
the bolt. The lower ends of the brass
are drilled to admit thumb tacks for
holding it to the drawing board.
</p>

<p>
The joint at E is made of a suitable
binding post that can be procured at
an electrical shop, the shank below
the two joined pieces to be the same
length as the height of the metal stand
D. The end should be filed round and
polished so that it will slip over the
board or paper easily.
</p>

<p>
The stylus or tracing point F is
made of another binding post, in the
same manner, but instead of a rounding
end a slightly blunt, pointed end
is filed on it. The end of the piece G
is strengthened by gluing a small block
of the same material on both upper
and under side. A hole is then made
through them to receive a pencil
rather tightly.
</p>

<p>
The holes, as will be seen, are numbered
from 1 to 34. At the crossing
of each pair, H and J, the screweyes
must be set in the holes numbered
alike on both pieces of each pair. This
will insure the proper working of the
parts. The other numbers designate
how much the instrument will enlarge
a picture or reduce it. On the pair
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>[143]</a></span>
not numbered in the sketch the numbers
run in the opposite direction.
</p>

<p>
The end C is fastened to the left
side of the drawing board, the picture
to be enlarged is placed under the
stylus or tracer point, and the paper
under the pencil point G. Move the
tracing point over the general outline
of the picture without making any line
before starting, so as to make sure that
the paper and picture are located right.
It is then only necessary to take hold
of the pencil and move it over the
paper while watching the tracer point
to keep it following the lines of the
picture. To make a reduced picture,
the original is placed under G, the
tracer point changed to G and the
pencil to F.

Protecting a Kettle Handle from Heat

</div>

<p>
The wood handle of a kettle or cooking
utensil when not in use usually
comes in contact with the side of the
vessel and it
will absorb
enough heat
each time to
finally char
and crack
the wood.
The heat of the handle at times is so intense
that it often results in a burned
hand. The spiral metal handle provides
a way for cooling by exposing a
considerable surface to the air, yet the
metal retains the heat so that many
times it is too hot to handle. If a wood
handle is provided with a coil of wire
as shown in the accompanying sketch,
the wood cannot come in contact with
the side of the heated vessel and the air
encircling the wood prevents it from
getting too hot to handle. The spiral
can be attached to a metal handle with solder.

18&nbsp;in. long. Nail the pieces firmly together,
as shown, and connect their
bases with another piece of the same
material, 36&nbsp;in. long. When this is
finished, connect the swing to the
standards with long nails, A, at the
ends slightly off center. Before inserting
the nails, make the holes in
each standard to receive them large
enough to permit the nails to turn
freely without allowing the heads to

filtering, emptying water from tubs,
producing a partial vacuum in vessels
in which coils are being boiled in paraffin,
etc., may be constructed as follows:
Obtain two pieces of brass
tubing of the following dimensions:
one 7&nbsp;in. long and 3/4&nbsp;in. outside diameter,
and the other, 3&nbsp;in. long and 1/4&nbsp;in. outside diameter. Drill a hole in
one side of the large tube, about 3&nbsp;in.
from one end, of such a diameter that
the small brass tube will fit it very
tightly. Take an ordinary hacksaw
and cut a slot in the side of the large
piece, as shown at A. This slot is
sawed diagonally across the tube and
extends from one side to the center.
Obtain a piece of sheet brass that will
fit into this slot tightly, and then
solder it and the small tube into the
large tube. The slot and hole for the
small tube should be so located with
respect to each other that the small
tube will empty into the larger one
directly against the piece of sheet
brass soldered in the slot.

shown, to a piece of glass tubing that
is sealed in the cork in the top of the
large bottle. The funnel holding the
filter paper is also sealed into the cork.
Melted paraffin may be used in sealing
the glass tube, funnel and cork in
place, the object being to make them
airtight. The filter paper should be
folded so that it sticks tightly against
the sides of the funnel when the liquid
is poured in, thus preventing any air
from entering the bottle between the
paper and the funnel. Turn on the
faucet, and it will be found that the
time required to filter any liquid will
be greatly reduced. Be careful, however,
not to turn on too much water,
as the suction may then be too strong
and the filter paper become punctured.

with a glass tube as
shown, and when in use
the cork is forced into

that no air can enter between
it and the glass.
The support for holding
the bottles has
two brackets, one to fit the neck of
the upper bottle and the other used
as a shelf for the receiving bottle.
In operation, the solution runs from
the upper bottle into the funnel, holding
the filter paper, but it cannot fill
the funnel completely, because the end
of the glass tube is lower than the
edge of the funnel, and as soon as the
liquid in the funnel covers the end of
the tube, all inflow of air into the
upper bottle is stopped, and, thereby,
further flow of the solution into the
funnel prevented, until enough has filtered
through to uncover the end of
the tube and thus permit air to again
enter the upper bottle.&mdash;Contributed

Grinding Scissors
</h2>


<p>
Whether a pair of scissors be ground
or filed, the marks or scratches left
from the contact with the abrasive
should all extend across the bevel in
the direction of the line ED, Fig.&nbsp;1, and
never in the direction of the line GF.
If the cutting edge be examined under
a magnifying glass, the tool marks or
scratches left by the sharpening process
will be very plainly seen, and where
these scratches intersect with the face
HI, Fig.&nbsp;2, of the blade, they will appear
as teeth along the cutting edge IK.

  <p>The Direction of the Grinding Tool should be Slightly
Sloping Toward the Handles</p>
</div>

<p>
As a pair of scissors close, the
natural tendency is to thrust the material
to be cut out of the angle ABC,
Fig.&nbsp;1, but if these small teeth formed
on the cutting edge point in the direction
of the line ED, this slipping action
is prevented or retarded because the
fibrous material adheres to the fine
teeth on the cutting edge of the blades.

To Repair a Leak in a Canoe

<p>
After striking some rocks with our
canoe, it sprung three very bad leaks.
These were effectively patched with
pieces of cheesecloth, well soaked in
liquid shellac, which were pasted on
the outside of the leak. After allowing
this to set for a few hours, it will
be almost impossible to remove the
patch. This is an inexpensive and almost
invariably a sure remedy for
leaks. When the cloth is dry, paint it
over with the same color as the boat,

How to Make a Watch Demagnetizer

  <p>Dimensioned Parts for the Construction of the Core
over Which the Insulated Wire is Wound</p>
</div>

<p>
Procure a sheet of 1/16&nbsp;in. brass, 3-1/4&nbsp;in. by 7&nbsp;in. Bend this piece of brass
around a piece of hard wood having
a rectangular cross section of 2-1/2&nbsp;in.
by 1&nbsp;in. The joint between the two
ends should be made on one side, and
the edges should lack about 1/8&nbsp;in. of
touching. Next obtain two pieces of
1/8&nbsp;in. brass, 3-3/4&nbsp;in. by 3&nbsp;in., and cut
an opening in each of these, 2-5/8&nbsp;in.
by 1-1/8&nbsp;in., as shown in the sketch.
Bend one edge of each of these pieces
over at right angles to the main portion
of the piece. Solder these two
pieces on the ends of the rectangular
tube of brass and cut a slot in each of
them to correspond to the one in the
rectangular tube. Place the rectangular
piece of wood back in the tube and
you are ready for the winding. Use
No. 18 gauge single cotton-covered
copper wire and fill the winding space.
Several layers of paper should be
placed on the brass tube and between
the layers of wire, to serve as an insulation.
Holes may be drilled in the
projecting portions on the ends and the
coil can then be mounted on a wooden
base. Mount two binding posts on
this base and connect the terminals of
the winding to them.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>[151]</a></span>
To use the demagnetizer, connect it
to a 110-volt alternating-current circuit
with a rheostat in circuit of such a
form that the current will not exceed
three amperes and that it may be reduced
to practically zero in value by
increasing the resistance of the rheostat.
The magnetic field inside the
coil is rapidly changing in direction
and will tend to destroy any permanent
magnetism that may be possessed
by an object placed inside of it. The
full current of three amperes should be
allowed to pass through the winding
for a few minutes after the object to
be demagnetized is inserted, and then
gradually reduced, and the object removed.

Remodeling a Talking Machine
</h2>


<p>
Having a talking machine of an old
model with a tapered horn I decided
to change it into a more modern type,
and this was accomplished as follows:
An auxiliary base was constructed of
1/2&nbsp;in. wood on which to set the part
which revolves the disks. The inside
of this base is so constructed as to
form a horn or sounding box. The two
sides and sloping bottom of the horn-part
are made of 1/4&nbsp;in. wood. The
form of this box is shown in Fig.&nbsp;1.
The dimensions should be determined
according to the size of the talking
machine.

  <p>...and the Part for Connecting the Sounding
Tube to the Box Consists of Ordinary Gas Pipe Fastened with a Clip at the Back (Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
The connecting parts to the original
horn were turned downward, as shown
at A, Fig.&nbsp;2, with the opening entering
a piece of ordinary gas pipe of sufficient
length to allow an elbow with a
nipple to enter the auxiliary base. The
pivot-holding device for connection
A is shown at D. The parts are
attached to the box with a clasp, E,
and with three screws in the nipple
C, the end view of which is shown at

A Mysterious Revolving Wheel
</h2>


<p>
The mystery of this wheel is that it
seems to revolve automatically without
any visible external power. It is
at the same time an amusing trick and
an instructive experiment. The apparatus
required is very simple and can
be made at home.

  <p>The Wheel as It is Mounted on a Needle, and Lamp
and Box Containing Magnet to Make It Turn</p>
</div>

<p>
A glass bottle is half filled with sand
and water, so that it will stand securely,
and a cork placed in the neck.
Into this cork a needle should be inserted
so that it projects perpendicularly,
which is most easily done by
heating one end of the needle to a
red heat and then pushing it into the
cork as deeply as possible. Into a
disk of cork of suitable thickness and
at four points on its side, at equal distances
apart, are inserted four pieces
of copper wire of the same length,
each bent at the outer end to form a
hook&mdash;these copper wires thus forming
the spokes of the wheel. The rim is
made of a small iron wire bent in a
circular shape and held in the hooks
on the ends of the copper wires. The
now completed wheel is balanced on
the free point on the needle, so that it
can turn easily.
</p>

<p>
Place an alcohol lamp in such a position
that when it is lighted the tip of
the flame will just reach the rim of the
wheel. (Any other flame that will not
soot the rim may be used.) In the
box A, placed with its bottom level
with the wheel, put a horseshoe
magnet so that the flame is opposite
one of its poles. After the lamp has
been lighted for a few seconds, the
wheel will begin to revolve, seemingly
without cause. Why does it do so?
Because the magnet magnetizes or attracts
the part of the ring nearest it
while cold, but not when it is glowing.
Instead, it will attract the cooler
part of the ring nearest behind the
flame and so on, the wheel thus spinning
round, faster in the same proportion
as the magnet is stronger and the
iron rim smaller.
</p>

<p>
If this experiment is shown before
spectators as a trick, the performer
may say to the audience that he alone
can make the wheel spin around without
touching it. Should some one accept
his challenge, he may, in a careless
way, move the box containing the
magnet away or turn it around so that
it will not influence the iron ring and
then, of course, the wheel will remain immovable.

To Maintain a Constant Level of Liquids in Vessels

<p>
It is frequently desirable in laboratory

as well, to maintain
a constant
level in a tank
without allowing
it to become
full. In many
cases an outlet
pipe at a certain
height in the
side of the tank
is not desirable, and in laboratory experiments
with beakers or crocks is, of
course, impossible.
</p>

<p>
The diagram shows a simple but effective
constant-level device. The
outer end of the inverted U-tube is
curved upward so that it never empties.
If desired, the upward curve may be
omitted and the straight end immersed
in a small vessel of water. All that
is necessary now for the successful
working of the device is that the inner
or tank end, A, of the tube be lower
than the outer end&mdash;in other words, below
the level of the end B&mdash;and the inner
end below the level of the fluid.
Of course, the U-tube must be first
filled with liquid and will then act as
an intermittent, never-breaking siphon.
Should the tank fill above the end B,
the siphon drains the fluid down to
that level and no lower, even if the inner
leg of the tube reach the bottom.
To maintain this level against loss by
evaporation some slight inflow is necessary.
</p>

<p>
It will be noted that if the inner
end of the siphon were above the outer
end, the siphon would break as soon
as the liquid in the tank fell to the
inner mouth.&mdash;Contributed by Harry

<h2>
Homemade Electric Bed Warmer

<p>
The heat developed by a carbon-filament

its use as a heating element of, for instance,
a bed warmer. There are a
number of other small heaters which
can be easily made and for which
lamps form very suitable heating elements,
but the bed warmer is probably
the best example. All that is required
is a tin covering which can be made of
an old can about 3-1/2&nbsp;in. in diameter.
The top is cut out and the edge filed
smooth. The lamp-socket end of the
flexible cord is inserted in the can and
the shade holder gripped over the
opening. A small lamp of about five
candlepower will do the heating.
</p>

<p>
A flannel bag, large enough to slip
over the tin can and provided with a
neck that can be drawn together by
means of a cord, gives the heater a
more finished appearance, as well as
making it more pleasant to the touch.

pull on the kite string does not
close the spring, but a sharp jerk will
pull the string in contact with the
push button and its slight pressure
causes an instant flash of the light.

<h2>
Hangers for Barn Tools
</h2>


<p>
Means should be provided to have a
place for all the tools used in and about
a barn. The forks and shovels are
usually stood up in a corner, but they
can be more conveniently taken care
of by making a hanger for them. The
illustration shows how a hanger can
be easily made and screwed to the
wall of a barn. The hanger is cut from
a piece of board and has a hole bored
into it the size of the handle on the
fork or shovel, then a notch is sawn
into the hole to pass the handle
through. The board may contain one
or as many notches as there are forks
and shovels to be hung on it. The
implements are hung with the fork or
shovel end upward.&mdash;Contributed by

Guide Ropes on a Bobsled
</h2>


<p>
The sketch shows the front end of
a bobsled or double runner made of a
plank bolted upon two sleds. The
front sled is so pivoted on the bolt A
that it may be turned to steer the bob,
and to accomplish this result the
steersman ordinarily sits with his feet
braced against the projecting ends of
the crosspiece and passes the steering
ropes outside of his feet, with the
ropes crossed as shown. The crossing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>[156]</a></span>
of the ropes is supposed to add
leverage, but that is quite wrong.

  <p>The Most Efficient Way of Attaching Ropes to
the Guiding Runners of a Bobsled</p>
</div>

<p>
The rope, running from B to C, has
a lever arm from A to E. If the ropes
were not crossed, the rope would lie
along the dotted line BD, whose lever
arm is the distance AF, which is always
greater than AE, therefore the
uncrossed ropes have more leverage.
</p>

<p>
Observe what takes place when the
sled is steered to the left: The distance
AE decreases much more rapidly
than AF, and when the crossed
ropes have lost all their power, the uncrossed
ropes are still useful. Many a
spill has been caused by turning the
sled to a position from which the
crossed ropes were unable to restore
it to a central position, and most of
such spills would have been avoided
if the ropes had not been crossed.&mdash;Contributed

Brush Hanger for a Dark Room
</h2>

</div>

<p>
Necessity may be the mother of invention,
but it is also the grandmother
of application, and application is the
practical side of invention. Both the
amateur and the professional photographer
have been
bothered by spotting
and unequal development
of negatives
and prints in tray development,
due to
various causes, and
sometimes by the
presence of dirt particles
or the unequal
or incomplete flowing
of the developer
over the surface of
the sensitive emulsion.
</p>

<p>
Most professionals
and many amateurs
are familiar with the
use of the camel's-hair brush to avoid
failures of this character, and many of
them use a brush for local development
in certain cases where it is necessary
or desirable. Usually the brush is kept
in a small glass cup, somewhere close
at hand, but it is often in the way when
not wanted and misplaced when most
needed. The brush can be kept within
reach and handy for the operator by
arranging a light counterweight and
pulley with a string attached to the
brush, so that, normally, the brush will
hang from the ceiling directly over the
developing tray and can be obtained
for use when desired.
</p>

<p>
The detail of this brush-string and
counterweight combination was deliberately
appropriated from the old plan
of suspending the piece of chalk over
a billiard table, so that the players
could easily reach it, when needed,
while, when released, it would be
pulled out of the way by the counterweight.
The developing brush thus
suspended is always ready, never misplaced,
nor in the way for other operations.
This arrangement is particularly
convenient where a bathroom is used
as a dark room, and the shelf space is limited.
</p>

<p>
This same manner of counterweighting
chalk on the billiard table may be
applied to a stove-lid lifter, to keep it
within easy reach and always cool
enough to handle. The simplest and
most inexpensive way of making this
apparatus is to cut off a small piece of
lead pipe for a counterweight, and, in
the absence of a suitable pulley, use
an ordinary screweye fastened in the
ceiling. The latter is really better
than a pulley because the string cannot
run off the screweye. The arrangement
is better understood by referring
to the sketch.

<h2>
Lighting a Basement Light
</h2>


<p>
There was no switch at the basement
door and it was difficult to find
the droplight in the dark. Instead of
going to the expense of placing a
switch, the contrivance illustrated and
described was rigged up and proved
equal to the requirements.
</p>

<p>
A 7/8-in. piece of wood was cut about
6&nbsp;in. long by 2&nbsp;in. wide and a recess
made at one end for the socket, as
shown. A 1/8-in. hole was drilled in the
center, about 2&nbsp;in. from one end, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>[157]</a></span>
another, large enough to receive the
projection from a pull socket, about 2&nbsp;in. from the other end, or the end to
be used as the bottom of the block.
A clamp made of spring brass, as
shown, was screwed securely to the
board, to clamp the socket firmly. A
wire was passed through the small
hole and stretched across the room
from the door at a height to bring the
light about 6&nbsp;ft. from the floor. Then
the socket was clamped to the strip
with the chain passed through the hole
cut for it. The cord attached to the
chain was run to the door casing,
passed through a screweye and
weighted with a nut or some light object,
to keep it taut. To light the
lamp or put it out only a pull on the
string was necessary.

<h2>
Projecting Protractor Readings
</h2>


<p>
A simple and efficient means of
projecting protractor readings to a
larger size is shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. One
point of the compass is placed at the
center of the protractor and an elastic
band is looped between the points.
Then the points are spread to the radius
desired, and the protractor is read
where the elastic band crosses its scale.
A light band should be used, and
looped as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2. In this
way a circle of any size may be quickly
divided, if a pencil mark is made each
time the band comes over the proper
figure.&mdash;Contributed by Thos. L. Parker, Wibaux, Mont.

<p>
When removing grease from paint

A good and cheaply applied method is
to rub the painted surface with a paste
of ordinary whiting. This is allowed
to dry and when it is rubbed off with
a cloth the dirt and grease is taken
away with it. The whiting is cheap

<h2>
Welding Small Resistance-Wire Connections
</h2>


<p>
In making connections, especially in
electrical heating devices subject to
high temperatures, it is out of the question
to use solder, since the temperature
reached in the device would cause
the solder to melt and run out. A convenient
arrangement for welding the
connections of flatirons, or any other
fine wires, is shown in the illustration.
The ends of the wires to be welded are
twisted together, and the weld is completed
by forming an arc, one electrode
of which is the twisted connection and
the other a piece of carbon. The resistance
of the heating unit in the iron
is sufficient to limit the amount of the
current flow so that a short circuit does
not result.&mdash;Contributed by G. Irving

<p>
The popular roller coaster that furnishes
untold amusement for the
multitudes that patronize amusement
parks during the summer can be easily
duplicated in a smaller way on a vacant
lot or back yard for the children of
the home; or the boys of a neighborhood
could contribute to a fund and
construct quite an elaborate affair, on
the same lines as described, for the
combined use of the owners. The one
described was built with a track, 90&nbsp;ft.
long, 5&nbsp;ft. high at one end and 3&nbsp;ft. at
the other, the track between being
placed on the ground. In coasting
from the high end to the low one, the
coaster will run up on the incline, then
drift back to within 24&nbsp;ft. of the starting
end. The car was built to seat four
children or two adults. The cost of
all the materials for building this roller
coaster did not exceed $10.

The track is of simple

It is necessary
to have it straight and
nailed firmly to the
crossties on the ground
and to the trestles where
it is elevated. The ties
and trestles are placed
about 6&nbsp;ft. apart. The
two trestles for the
starting platform

there is a slant to the

back for starting by adults, but for
children a small rope can be used over
the platform to draw it back on the
track, or a small windlass may be arranged
for the purpose.

and 1&nbsp;in. thick, and are set on the
bicycle cone of the ball cup, after they
are properly adjusted, and securely
fastened between washers with a nut
on the end of the axle. Guide wheels,
B, are placed on the sides in the manner
shown. These wheels are ordinary
truck casters, not the revolving kind,
2&nbsp;in. in diameter.

<p>
About 1/2-in. clearance should be
provided between the guide wheels B
and the guard rail C, on the track.
When the car is made in this manner
it runs close to the track and there is
no place where a child can get a foot

Door-Bell Alarm

<p>
A simple door-bell alarm for informing
one when the door of a shop or
dwelling is opened is shown in the
accompanying sketch. It consists of a
piece of spring brass, A, bent into a
circle in the center so that it may be
clamped on the doorknob bar by means
of a small bolt or screw. The two ends
of this piece should be separated as
shown and a second piece, B, mounted
on the door so that its outwardly projecting
end is between the ends of the
piece A. One terminal of an ordinary
vibrating bell circuit is then connected
under the head of the clamp screw, and
the other terminal under one of the
screws holding the piece B in place on
the door. It is now obvious that the
bell circuit will be completed and the
alarm sounded when the knob is
turned. Make sure that the piece A is
bent so that the circuit is completed
before the latch has moved a sufficient
amount to allow the door to open.

These consist of 4 pieces, each

In the center of each piece cut a notch
one-half the thickness so that when
each pair of pieces is crossed they will
fit together with the surfaces smooth,
as shown at D. A square hole is cut
through the pieces as shown to fit on
the square part of the main axle.
While it is not shown in the illustration,
it is best to strengthen this joint

The ends of the threads are

front of the stage, diagonally, and there
manipulated by some one in a wing
near the front, standing high enough to
prevent the threads from touching the
heads of the actors. These bright little

the trees appear very lifelike, and with
the addition of a crescent moon just
peeping through the trees, the likeness

<p>
Such parts of a camera that are apt
to reflect light must be covered with a
dull black. A mixture for this purpose
is made of lampblack, about a teaspoonful,
and enough gold size to make a
paste as thick as putty. Add about
twice the volume of turpentine and apply
to the parts with a camel's-hair brush.

As the turpentine fumes are detrimental
to the sensitive plate, the
camera should be left open until these
fumes have entirely disappeared.

<p>
The base is 7/8&nbsp;in. thick and of the
dimensions shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. The projection
on each side, measuring 6-1/2&nbsp;in.
long and 1&nbsp;in. wide, is made separately
and glued to the main part after dressing
and beveling the edges.
</p>

<p>
The shelf consists of material 2&nbsp;in.
thick and made in a semicircular form
on a radius of 5-3/4&nbsp;in. On this arc, lay
off chords, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1; the first
ones on each side being one-half the
length of the others. Carefully square
up the edges for appearance. To lay
off the post holes, scribe an arc of a

edge on this arc and lay off eight
chords of equal lengths, and bore 1/2-in.
holes on the marks.
</p>

<p>
The posts are turned up, as shown
by the detail, Fig.&nbsp;3. This will require
seven posts and two half posts. The
half posts are secured to the base with
small brads. The round part at the end
is turned slightly tapering, so as to
make a tight fit in the hole of the shelf.
After stringing the posts on a piece of
brass wire, 1/8&nbsp;in. in diameter, and bending
it in the proper shape, the posts
are glued in the holes.
</p>

<p>
A T-shaped slot with a long top and
a short leg is cut out with a scroll saw
in one end of each arm. Make sure
to have each slot exactly 1/2&nbsp;in. from
the upper side of each arm. All edges
should be well rounded to prevent tearing
of the clothes.
</p>

<p>
Make a semicircular platform for
the arms to bear upon when extended.
This may be either half of a turned disk
or built up in the three segments, each
fastened with screws to the base. If
the brass wire is exactly 1&nbsp;in. from the
shelf and the thickness of the wood between
the T-slot and the upper edge of
the arm 1/2&nbsp;in., the thickness of the
platform should be slightly under 1/2&nbsp;in. to make the arms rest horizontally
when they are extended.
</p>

<p>
The shelf is fastened to the base
with three or four 2-in. screws, and the
ends of the brass wire are run through
holes in the base and clinched on the
back side. The rack may be fastened
in place on the kitchen wall with two
large wood screws, or, if the wall is
brick, with expansion bolts. The fastening
in either case must be secure to
hold the heavy weight of wet clothes.&mdash;Contributed

<p>
Two sides are cut out, as shown, and
the boards are nailed or, better still,
screwed to them. Each straight part
may consist of one piece, in which
case there will be no joints to make
waterproof, but if boards of sufficient
size cannot be had, pieces can be used.
In this instance the edges should be
planed smooth, so that a good joint
may be had, which can be made watertight
with white lead.
</p>

<p>
It is best to make the bottom of one
piece if possible, at least for the length
of the curve. The wood is thoroughly
steamed, then fastened in place on the
curved part.
</p>

<p>
A strap of suitable length is fastened
on the top for the toe, so that the boats
can be controlled with the feet.
</p>

<p>
To propel the boats along easily, a
web or wing should be attached to the
under side, so that it will catch the
water on the back thrust while it will
fold up when the boat is slid forward.&mdash;Contributed

Persons rowing boats, particularly

turning a screweye of sufficient size to
prevent binding on the lock into the
oar and placing it over the lock as
shown at A, so that the pull will be
against the metal. The oars will never
slip or jump out, will always be in the
right position, and it is not necessary
to pull them into the boat to prevent
loss when not rowing. The locks will
not wear the oars, as the pull is on the
metal eye. Place the eye so it will
have a horizontal position on the side
of the oar when the blade is in its right position.

lock are the five disks shown in
Fig.&nbsp;1. These are best made of sheet
brass, about 1/16&nbsp;in. thick and 1-1/2&nbsp;in. in
diameter. The pins for turning the
disks are each made a driving fit for a
hole drilled through the metal at a
point 15/32&nbsp;in. from the center. Notches
are cut in the disks C, D and E, Fig.&nbsp;1,
to receive the latch end, and the disk
B is made like a cam, its use being to
raise the latch into its keeper when the
handle is turned backward. The disk
A is without a notch and has only a
pin for turning the other disks.

pin, G, as their bearing. The disks
are placed on this pin with rubber
washers, H, J, K, L and M, between
them. These serve the purpose of preventing
the disks from turning too
freely. The disk A is fastened tightly
to the end of the rod N, which is 1/4&nbsp;in.
in diameter. The outer end of this
rod is fitted with a handle or turning
head as desired. That shown at O is
made of two pieces of wood screwed
together, with a pointer, P, placed between
them. A washer, R, is placed
between the drawer end and the handle
to take up any looseness and to allow

A dial, S, is made of paper and the
division marks and numbers placed
upon it. The latch T is fitted in a U-shaped
piece of metal, U, which is fastened
to the inside of the drawer end
where its heel will rest on the edges of
the disks. When the right combination
is made by turning the handle first one
way and then the other, the latch will
drop into the notches of the disks as
they will be all in one place.
</p>

<p>
When the drawer is to be locked,
turn the handle back from the last
turn made for the combination and the
latch will be driven upward into its
keeper and the notches scattered so
that the latch will not drop until the
combination is again set.
</p>

<p>
The numbers for the combination
can be found after the disks are in
place and by turning the handle until
the notch comes up to the place for the
heel of the latch. The number beneath
the pointer is noted; then the next
turned up in a like manner, all being
done while the drawer is open and the
disks in plain sight. The combination

Small machine screws are sometimes
very difficult to start, especially when
used in parts of a
machine that cannot
be easily reached
with the fingers. A
good way to start
them is by means of
a piece of fine wire
wound snugly
around the screw under
its head. They
can be placed and started by means of
the wire and when the first threads
have caught the screw it can be held
by the screwdriver while the wire is
withdrawn.&mdash;Contributed by F. W.

<h2>
Holder for a Milk Card

<p>
It is the general practice of milkmen
to furnish a monthly card on which
the housewife marks the needs of the
day and then hangs
it outside of the
door for the information
of the driver.
This card also serves
as a record for checking
the accounts of
the milk delivered
during the month,
and therefore it is
desirable to protect
it from snow and sleet.
</p>

<p>
In order to furnish
this protection and
at the same time
make it unnecessary for any one to go
outside of the door to hang up the
card on stormy days, one of our readers
has submitted the following plan
which he has used for some time.
</p>

<p>
On the outside of the kitchen door,
where the milkman is to deliver his
bottles, this man has fastened an
ordinary picture frame with glass but
no backing except the door. Through
the door and just below the upper
edge of the glass is cut a thin slot inclining
downward and outward so that
the milk card can be easily pushed
through the slot and thus be displayed
behind the glass in the frame.
By this protection it is kept free from
mud, snow and ice. It is not necessary
to step outside to place the card
in the frame.

Inlaying Metals by Electroplating

<p>
Very pretty and artistic effects of
silver or nickel inlay on bronze, copper,
etc., or copper on dark oxidized metals,
may be obtained by means of etching
and electroplating.
</p>

<p>
The metal on which the inlay is to
be used is first covered with a thin
coating of wax and the design
scratched through to the metal with a
sharp, hard point of some kind. The
design is then etched in slowly with
well diluted nitric acid, allowing the
etching to penetrate quite deeply. The
metal is then taken out and after a
thorough rinsing in water is hung in
the plating bath.
</p>

<p>
As the wax has been left on, the
plating will fill the lines of the design
only, and will not touch the covered
surface. When the etched lines are
filled, the object is taken out of the
bath and the wax removed.&mdash;Contributed

true and round, such as used in
bearings. The other materials usually
can be found in any store. Procure
some thick cardboard and cut two
disks, 8&nbsp;in. in diameter, and two disks,
7-1/2&nbsp;in. in diameter. Glue these together
to make the wheel A, the larger
disks forming the flanges. Make a
smaller wheel, B, the size of which will
be governed by the speed of the motor
used. The wheel A is mounted in a
box to run with its surface close to the
under side of the cover, which should
be of a thin, stiff cardboard. The wheel
B is mounted on an axle that runs in
metal bearings. The magnet D is
placed on the wheel A. The steel
ball E is put on the thin cover of the
box, and the magnet causes it to roll
around as the wheel turns. The box
inclosing the mechanical parts should
be placed out of sight when used in a

with a vise handy, the measurement

trick is particularly adapted for calipering
threaded parts, as threads cannot
be measured readily with ordinary

How to Make a Radium Photograph
</h2>


<p>
The radium rays, like the X-rays, affect
the photographic plate, as is well
known, but it would naturally be supposed
that the enormous cost of radium
would prevent the making of such a
photograph by the amateur.
</p>

<p>
It is a fact, however, that a radium
photograph can be made at home at
practically no cost at all, provided the
amateur has patience enough to gather
the necessary material, which is nothing
else but broken incandescent gas
mantles. These (especially Welsbach
mantles) contain a salt of the rare
metal thorium, which is slightly radioactive.
The thing to do, then, is to
collect a sufficient quantity of broken
mantles to cover the bottom of a small
cardboard box&mdash;a dryplate box, for instance&mdash;with
a layer of powdered
mantle substance. Upon this layer
and pressed tightly against it is placed
a piece of cardboard; then some metal
objects, a button, hairpin, a buckle, or
the like, are laid on the cardboard and
covered with a sensitized paper. This
is again covered with a piece of cardboard
and the box filled with crumpled
paper to the top. The cover is then
put on, the box tied up with a piece of
string and set in some place where it
is sure to be left undisturbed.
</p>

<p>
The radium rays from the powdered
mantles readily penetrate the cardboard
and paper, but not the metal articles.
Being very weak, the rays must be
given four weeks to accomplish their
work. After that time, however, if the
sensitive paper is taken out, pictures of
the metal objects in white on a dark
background will be found on it. These
pictures will not be so sharp as ordinary
photographs, because the rays are
not focused, but they fairly represent
the originals and the experiment is an
interesting one.

Uses for a Bamboo Pole
</h2>


<p>
Select a good bamboo pole, about
18&nbsp;ft. long, and cut it into three lengths
as follows: A piece from the top, 2-1/2&nbsp;ft. long; the next length, 5-1/2&nbsp;ft. long,
and the remaining end of the pole,
about 10&nbsp;ft. long. The 2-1/2-ft. length is
equipped with a screw hook in the
smaller end, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. This
stick is useful in lowering window
shades that have a ring or screw eye
attached to the lower part of the shade.
When the stick is not in use, it is hung
on the edge of the window casing.

The 5-1/2-ft. length makes the long
handle for a duster. Procure an old-style
lamp-chimney cleaner, wind a
cord around the wires a few inches below
the point where they begin to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>[174]</a></span>
spread to keep them from coming
apart, then cut or file the wires off 2&nbsp;in. below the winding. This leaves a
straight shank, over which a ferrule
is slipped before it is inserted into the
small end of the pole. Fill the remaining
space in the pole end with plaster
of Paris, and when it has set, slip the
ferrule into place on the pole end. If
a ferrule is not at hand, a fine wire can
be wound around the end to prevent
the pole from splitting. When using
this pole to dust hardwood floors, tops
of doors, window casings and picture
frames, put a dusting cloth into the
claws and slide the ring into place, as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;2.
</p>

<p>
The longer and larger end of the
pole is used as a clothesline pole. One
end of this pole is fitted with a yoke
made of No. 6 gauge galvanized wire,
as shown in Fig.&nbsp;3. The wire for the
yoke is 10&nbsp;in. long, and after bending
it in shape, the two upper ends should
be 2&nbsp;in. wide at the top and 2&nbsp;in. deep.
Insert the straight end of the wire into
the smaller end of the pole and set it
in firmly with plaster of Paris. The
end of the pole should be securely
wound with wire to keep the bamboo
from splitting.&mdash;Contributed by Gertrude

produce a polish, then apply a 10-per-cent
solution of iron sulphate. A
chemical reaction takes place as the
last solution is rubbed into the leather,
making it black. After this is dry,

In use, when opening the vise by
means of the screw, the rack will drag
along the plate, and stop and engage a
notch when the opening operation
ceases. When it is desired to reduce
the opening, it is only necessary to lift
the rail by means of the string D. A

<h2>
Removing Vegetable Stains
</h2>


<p>
To remove stains of vegetables or
fruits of any kind from cloth or wood,
the following method is very good:
The stained piece is first moistened
with water and then placed in a jar or
pail that can be covered. A lump of
sulphur is ignited and dropped into
the jar. Place the sulphur on a fire
shovel when lighting it to avoid burns.
The burning sulphur should be placed
in the receptacle on the side where the
stain will be exposed to the fumes.
The sulphur burns slowly so that the
articles will not be harmed.
</p>

<p>
After the sulphur has burned away,
the jar should be kept closed for a few
minutes and when the articles are
removed, the stains will be gone. This
is harmless to try, and the cloth will
not be injured if it is in a dry condition.
The articles should be washed
and dried as soon as they are taken
out of the jar.

<h2>
Picture-Frame Corner Joints
</h2>


<p>
Very often the amateur craftsman
comes across a picture which he
would like to have framed, but the
difficulty and insecurity of the ordinary
miter joint for the corners discourage
him from trying to make the frame. A
very easy way to construct a rigid
frame is shown in the illustration.
The size of the frame must be determined
by the picture to be framed.
The width, A, of the pieces depends
upon one's own taste.
</p>

<p>
Four pieces, the desired length and
width and 1/2&nbsp;in. thick, should be
dressed out of the material intended
for the frame. Four other pieces, 3/8&nbsp;in. thick and 1/2&nbsp;in. narrower than the
first four pieces, are next made ready
and fastened with glue and flat-head
screws to the back of the first pieces,
as shown. This allows 3/8&nbsp;in. for glass,
picture and backing, and 1/2&nbsp;in. to lap
over the front of the picture on all edges.

<h2>
Hunting-Knife Handles
</h2>


<p>
Very artistic handles for hunting
knives and carving sets can be made
by using disks of horn. Procure some
cowhorns from a slaughter house and
split them with a saw, using only the
large portion of the horn. The split
horn is then heated by dry heat&mdash;an
oven is best&mdash;then pressed between
two cold plates to a flat piece. If well
heated, it is surprising how easily this
can be done. The piece is then cut
into squares of suitable size which are
marked and perforated in the center,
the hole being a trifle smaller than
the tang of the blade. The tang should
be flat and a little longer than the
desired handle, with the end made
round and threaded for a nut.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img177a'>
  <img src='images/img177a.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Finished Handle, If the Work is Well Done, is
Easily Mistaken for Agate</p>
</div>

<p>
A suitable washer is placed on the
tang, which is then heated sufficiently
to burn its way through the pieces of
horn as they are put on the metal.
When a sufficient number of disks are
on the tang a washer should be slipped
on and followed by a round nut. Pressure
is applied by turning the nut and
repeated heatings of the disks will
force them together to make perfect
joints. Only a moderate pressure
should be applied at a time.
</p>

<p>
The handle is now to be finished to
the shape desired. If black and colored
pieces of horn are interspersed,
the finished handle will have the appearance
of agate. The blade and handle
can be lacquered and the ferrules
nickelplated.&mdash;Contributed by James

<p>
Anyone who has used a sawbuck
knows how inconvenient it is to have
a stick roll or lift up as the saw blade
is pulled back for the next cut. With
the supplementary device, shown in
the sketch, which can be easily attached
to the sawbuck, these troubles
will be eliminated. It consists of two
crosspieces hinged to the back uprights
of the sawbuck and a foot-pressure
stirrup fastened to their front ends as
shown. Spikes are driven through the
crosspieces so that their protruding
ends will gouge into the stick of wood
being sawed. The stirrup is easily
thrown back for laying a piece of wood
in the crotch.

<p>
The trouble caused by overflowing
of the drip pan for an ice box or refrigerator
can be overcome by attaching
a device that will sound an alarm
when the water reaches a level safely
below the overflow point. A device
of this kind may be attached to the
back of the refrigerator as shown in
the sketch. A float, A, is attached to
the lower end of a rod, B, which slides
through staples CC. At the upper end
of the rod, a V-shaped copper sheet,
D, is soldered. This makes the contact
points in the electric wiring. The
battery E can be placed under or back
of the refrigerator as desired. The
method of wiring is clearly shown.

Every fisherman knows that live
bait will soon die if they do not receive
sufficient air. I have succeeded in
keeping bait
alive and healthy
by using a pail
of my own construction,
which is provided with
a compressed-air
space to force air
to the surface of
the water. The
air space A takes
up one-fifth of
the interior at
the bottom of the pail, and an ordinary
hand bicycle pump is used to fill
it through a bicycle-tire valve, B. The
pipe C from the air space extends up
along the side of the pail and the upper
end is bent so that it just touches
the surface of the water. The pipe contains
a valve to regulate the flow of air.
</p>

<p>
After the pail has been standing for
an hour or more, the bait will rise to
the top. The valve is then opened for
a few minutes, and the minnows will
soon swim around in the water as
when this was fresh.&mdash;Contributed by

I could not catch them in the

away from other
things, I took a
dinner plate, a
bowl that held
about 1&nbsp;qt., a
thimble, filled
with toasted
cheese, and arranged the articles as
shown in the sketch, balancing the
bowl on the thimble. When the
mouse nibbled the cheese, the bowl
came down on it, making it a prisoner.
The whole was then dropped in a pail
of water. Scald the dish and bowl before
using them again to remove all

<h2>
Sunlight Flasher for the Garden<br />
By Claude L. Woolley
</h2>


<p>
The following apparatus is likely to
be novel, and certainly very striking
when erected on country estates, particularly
on high lands, hillsides, and
along the seashore, where the flashes
may be seen for many miles out at sea.
</p>

<p>
It is not unusual in country gardens
to see a large hollow glass globe silvered
on the inside, mounted on a pedestal,
brilliantly reflecting the sunlight.
The apparatus described is an elaboration
of the idea. The drawing shows
in diagram the general construction,
exact measurements not being given.
However, a convenient height is 3-1/2
to 4&nbsp;ft., and the circular frame, carrying
the mirrors, may be 10 to 14&nbsp;in.
in diameter.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img179b'>

    alt=''
    />
  </a>
  <p>The Flasher as It Appears on the Stand and the
Details of Its Construction</p>
</div>

<p>
The supporting frame, of galvanized
sheet iron or sheet copper, may be
either circular or hexagonal in shape.
Mounted upon a vertical shaft is a
skeleton circular frame, carrying a
double row of small mirrors, or ordinary
flat mirror glass, mounted in
grooves provided for them; the upper
row inclined slightly upward, and the
lower row slightly downward. If a
greater number of angles of reflection
are desired, the mirrors may be smaller,
and arranged in four circular rows instead
of two, each row being inclined
at a slightly different angle.
</p>

<p>
The shaft is pointed at the lower end
and rests in a bearing drilled with a
V-shaped depression, the bearing being
supported by soldering or riveting at
each end to the inner sides of the pedestal
shell. The upper portion of the
shaft passes through a bearing which is
also soldered or riveted at the ends, to
the inner surfaces of the pedestal shell.
</p>

<p>
The mirrors, mounted on the shaft,
thus are free to revolve vertically with
very little friction. Upon the lower
end of the shaft is fastened a light gear
wheel of rather large diameter, and this
in turn is geared to a smaller gear
mounted on the end of the armature
shaft of a small electric motor of the
type that may be driven with a few dry
cells; the relation of the sizes of the
gears being such as will cause the mirrors
to revolve slowly, when the motor
is running at normal speed.
</p>

<p>
Connected to the motor are two or
more dry, or other suitable batteries, a
small door being provided on the side
of the lower part of the pedestal to
enable the batteries to be replaced, or
turned off, and to give access to the
motor. A circular shield is erected
over the mirror carrier, surmounted by
an ornamental ball, to protect from the
weather and to provide a more finished
appearance. A waterproof canvas cover
may be slipped over the whole in rainy weather.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>[180]</a></span>
As new mirror faces at varying
angles are constantly being presented
to the sun, vivid flashes are constantly
occurring when viewed from almost
any angle or position on the side where
the sun is shining. The circular shield
on top is supported in position by four
metal strips secured by soldering to the
shield and the supporting pedestal.
</p>

<p>
Such a device may be constructed
without much expense, producing a
most brilliant effect over miles of territory.
The small driving motor may
be replaced with a suitable spring or
weight-driven clockwork; or four hollow
hemispherical metal cups may be
mounted on arms, or placed at right
angles, and the arms in turn mounted
upon a vertical shaft and arranged
above the mirror carrier and geared in
such manner that the mirrors will
revolve slowly, while the cups are revolving
with comparatively high speed
by the force of the wind.
</p>

<p>
The mounted revolving cups are similar
in form to the apparatus used by
the U. S. Weather Bureau for measuring
the speed of the wind. They
will respond to a good breeze from any
point of the compass.

<h2>
An Automatic Blowpipe
</h2>


<p>
A fine-pointed flame can be used to
advantage for certain work, and the
alcohol flame and blowpipe have become
a necessity,
but these may be
improved upon
so as to make
the apparatus
automatic in action
and more
efficient in its
work. A bottle or receptacle, A, having
a large bottom to provide a sufficient
heating surface, is supplied with
a cork and a tube, B, bent at right
angles. The receptacle, A, is supported
on a stand so that it may be
heated with a small lamp, C. The light
D may be a candle, alcohol lamp, or
any flame set at the right distance
from the end of the tube B.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img180a'>
  <img src='images/img180a.png' alt='img180a' title='img180a' />
</div>

<p>
The receptacle A is partly filled with
alcohol, and the heating lamp lit. The
heat will turn the alcohol into gas and
cause a pressure, driving it through
the tube B, so that it is ignited by the
flame from D. The flame will have a
fine point with sufficient heat to melt
glass.&mdash;Contributed by W. R. Sears,

Homemade Steam-Turbine Engine
</h2>


<p>
Select a tomato can, or any can in
which vegetables or fruit is sold, and
carefully unsolder the small cap on the
end when removing the contents.
When the can is empty, clean it well
and solder the cap in place again.
Procure a strip of brass, bend it as
shown at A and solder it to the can top
in the center. Cut a piece of about
No. 14 gauge wire, the length equal to
the opening between the uprights of
the U-shaped piece of brass, with about
1/2&nbsp;in. added for a small pulley wheel.
The uprights are punched or drilled at
their upper ends to admit the wire
which is then adjusted in place.

bent to fit over the wire shaft. These
are soldered to the wire between the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>[181]</a></span>
uprights. A small hole is punched on
one side in the top of the can so that it
will center the paddle of the wheel. On
the opposite side of the top another
larger hole is punched and tightly fitted
with a wood plug. This is the opening
for filling the boiler with water. The
can should be filled about two-thirds
full and set on a stove. The steam,
coming under pressure from the small
hole, strikes the paddles of the wheel
with considerable force and causes it
to revolve rapidly. Be careful not to
set the boiler on too hot a fire.

  <p>Time Switch for Operating an Electric Light in
Printing Photographic Developing Papers</p>
</div>

<p>
The device consists of an ordinary
cheap watch, a standard, or support, for
an adjusting screw, a small coil, a movable
armature, a knife switch, and a
trip arrangement. A neat box or case,
about 5&nbsp;in. square and 3&nbsp;in. high, is first
constructed. A round recess, 1/8&nbsp;in.
deep, is cut in the center of the top, to
admit the watch. The standard A is
made of brass, 1/8&nbsp;in. thick and 1/2&nbsp;in.
wide, bent as shown, and a 3/16-in. hole is
drilled in the end of the long arm where
it will exactly center over the pivot
holding the watch hands. A 3/16-in. rod,
B, is closely fitted in the hole and supplied
with a knurled wheel, C, on the
upper end, and an L-shaped arm, D,
is fastened to the lower end. The end
of this arm should be filed to a point,
or a very thin piece of brass soldered
to it, so that the end will just touch the
minute hand of the watch. The tip
end of the point should be bent slightly
from the perpendicular toward the direction
in which the watch hands are
moving, so that, when it is set, the
moving hand will easily break the contact.
</p>

<p>
The magnetic arrangement consists
of a 3-ohm coil, E, mounted, as shown,
to one side of the case, where it operates
the trip levers. The armature parts
consist of an L-shaped piece of brass,
F, pivoted at G, to which a square piece
of soft iron, H, is attached. Two small
parts, K, are bent and attached as
shown, to furnish a limit stop for the
piece F and a support for a spiral spring
which holds the armature H away from
the coil.
</p>

<p>
The knife switch L is fastened to the
bottom of the case so that the handle
will project through a slot in one side
of the box. A trip piece, M, and a
small eye for attaching a spiral spring,
N, are soldered to the knife switch.
These two attachments for the switch
are insulated from the other parts.
</p>

<p>
Two binding posts are mounted on
top, one being connected to one terminal
of the coil E and the other to the
watch case. The other terminal of the
coil is connected to the standard A.
The two binding posts are connected
in series with one or two dry cells, and
the switch L is connected in series with
the lamp used for printing.
</p>

<p>
The operation is as follows: The arm
D, being set for a certain time, the lever
of the switch L is set and the light remains
lit until the minute hand strikes
the point on the arm D, when the battery
circuit is closed causing the coil
to draw the armature H and allowing
the spring N to open the switch L.
The lamp is then extinguished.&mdash;Contributed

  <p>The Heliograph as It is Used by Neighboring

How to Make a Heliograph<br />
By R. B. Huey
</h2>


<p>
The heliograph which is used in the
army provides a good method of sending
messages by the reflection of the
sun's rays. In the mountains there
are stations from which messages are
sent by the heliograph for great distances,
and guides carry them for use
in case of trouble or accident. The
wireless telegraph delivers messages
by electricity through the air, but the
heliograph sends them by flashes of light.
</p>

<p>
The main part of the instrument is
the mirror, which should be about 4&nbsp;in. square, set in a wood frame and
swung on trunnions made of two
square-head bolts, each 1/4&nbsp;in. in diameter,
and 1&nbsp;in. long, which are
firmly held to the frame with brass
strips, 1/2&nbsp;in. wide, and 3&nbsp;in. long. The
strips are drilled centrally to admit the
bolts, and then drilled at each end for
a screw to fasten them to the frame.
This construction is clearly shown in Fig.&nbsp;1.

Top, the Whole being Adjusted to Reflect the Sun's Rays in Any Direction Desired
(Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
A hole is cut centrally through the
backing of the frame and a small hole,
not over 1/8&nbsp;in. in diameter, is scratched
through the silvering on the glass. If
the trunnions are centered properly,
the small hole should be exactly in line
with them and in the center.

<p>
A U-shaped support is made of
wood strips, 3/8&nbsp;in. thick and 1&nbsp;in. wide,
the length of the uprights being 3-1/2&nbsp;in.
and the crosspiece connecting their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>[184]</a></span>
lower ends a trifle longer than the
width of the frame. These are put together,
as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2, with small
brackets at the corners. A slot, 1/2&nbsp;in.
deep and 1/4&nbsp;in. wide, is cut into the
upper end of each upright to receive
the trunnions on the mirror frame.
Nuts are turned on the bolt ends
tightly, to clamp the standard tops
against the brass strips on the mirror
frame. The cross strip at the bottom
is clamped to the base by means of a
bolt, 1-1/2&nbsp;in. long. The hole for this
bolt should be exactly below the peephole
in the mirror and run through one
end of the baseboard, which is 3/4&nbsp;in.
thick, 2&nbsp;in. wide and 10&nbsp;in. long.

At the opposite end of the base,
place a sighting rod, which is made as
follows: The rod is 1/2&nbsp;in. in diameter
and 8&nbsp;in. long. The upper end is
fitted with a piece of thick, white cardboard,
cut 1/4&nbsp;in. in diameter and having
a projecting shank 1&nbsp;in. long, as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;3. The rod is placed in
a 1/2-in. hole bored in the end of the
baseboard, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2. To keep
the rod from slipping through the hole
a setscrew is made of a small bolt with
the nut set in the edge of the baseboard,
as shown in Fig.&nbsp;4.

  <p>The Parts in Detail for Making the Tripods...
(Fig.&nbsp;5, Fig.&nbsp;6)</p>
</div>

<p>
The tripod head is formed of a wood
disk, 5&nbsp;in. in diameter, with a hole in
the center, and three small blocks of
wood, 1&nbsp;in. square and 2&nbsp;in. long, nailed
to the under side, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;5.
The tripod legs are made of light
strips of wood, 3/8&nbsp;in. thick, 1&nbsp;in. wide
and 5&nbsp;ft. long. Two of these strips,
nailed securely together to within 20&nbsp;in. of the top, constitute one leg. The
upper unnailed ends are spread to slip
over the blocks on the tripod top.
These ends are bored to loosely fit over
the headless nails driven part way into
the block ends. One tripod leg is
shown in Fig.&nbsp;6.

  <p>...and
the Shutter for Flashing
the Light,... (Fig.&nbsp;7, Fig.&nbsp;8)</p>
</div>

<p>
The screen, or shutter, is mounted
on a separate tripod and is shown in
Fig.&nbsp;7. Cut out two slats, 3/8&nbsp;in. thick,
2-1/2&nbsp;in. wide and 6&nbsp;in. long, from hard
wood, and taper both edges of these
slats down to 3/16&nbsp;in. Small nails are
driven into the ends of the slats and
the heads are filed off so that the projecting
ends will form trunnions for
the slats to turn on. Make a frame of
wood pieces, 3/4&nbsp;in. thick and 2-1/2&nbsp;in. wide,
the opening in the frame being
6&nbsp;in. square. Before nailing the frame
together bore holes in the side uprights
for the trunnions of the slats to turn
in. These holes are 1-3/4&nbsp;in. apart. The
frame is then nailed together and also
nailed to the tripod top. The shutter
is operated with a key very similar to
a telegraph key. The construction of
this key is shown in Fig.&nbsp;7. A part of
a spool is fastened to a stick that is
pivoted on the opposite side of the
frame. The key is connected to the
slats in the frame with a bar and rod,
to which a coil spring is attached, as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;8. Figure 9 shows the
positions of the tripods when the instrument
is set to flash the sunlight
through the shutter. The regular telegraph
code is used in flashing the light.

<p>
To set the instrument, first turn the
cardboard disk down to uncover the
point of the sight rod, then sight
through the hole in the mirror and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>[185]</a></span>
adjust the sight rod so that the tip end
comes squarely in line with the receiving
station. When the instrument is
properly sighted, the shutter is set up
directly in front of it and the cardboard
disk is turned up to cover the
end of the sight rod. The mirror is
then turned so that it reflects a beam
of light with a small shadow spot
showing in the center made by the
peephole in the mirror, which is directed
to fall on the center of the cardboard
sighting disk. It will be quite
easy to direct this shadow spot to the
disk by holding a sheet of paper 6 or 8&nbsp;in. in front of the mirror and following
the spot on the paper until it reaches
the disk. The flashes are made by
manipulating the key operating the
shutter in the same manner as a telegraph key.

Starting a Siphon
</h2>


<p>
It is often necessary in a laboratory
to siphon acids and poisonous liquids.
If a pump is used there is always danger
of the liquid
entering the
pump and damaging
it, and, besides,
a pump is
not handy for
this purpose. To
fill a siphon by
suction from the
mouth, great
care must be
taken to keep
from drawing the liquid into the mouth.
One of the best ways to fill a siphon is
to procure a large dropper and having
pressed all the air out of the bulb insert
the end in the siphon. Releasing
the pressure on the bulb will cause it
to draw the liquid into the siphon.&mdash;Contributed

shoe-packing box for the foundation.
This was covered with matting and
the edges and corners finished with
wood strips, 1/2&nbsp;in. thick and stained a
dark red. Three trays were provided
on the inside at the top part of the
box, each of the two upper ones occupying
one-fourth of the box opening
and sliding on a pair of guides
fastened to the sides of the box while
the lower tray is one-half the length
of the box and slides on guides placed
far enough below the upper trays to
allow it to pass beneath these. The
three trays were used for keeping sewing
materials, such as buttons, hooks
and eyes, etc. When the trays are all
moved to one end it gives access to
the lower part of the box where the
work or mending is kept out of sight.

Cutting a Glass Bottle

<div class='imgfl' id='img186c'>
  <img src='images/img186c.png' alt='img186c' title='img186c' />
</div>

<p>
It is sometimes necessary to cut a
heavy glass bottle or cylinder. Four
methods are in use. A carborundum
disk having a thin
edge, if kept wet
and rotated at a high
speed, will cut heavy
glass, but the cylinder
must be fed
against the wheel
very gently. A better
way is to make a
file mark&mdash;clean,
but not very deep&mdash;around the cylinder
and heat it with a long slender
flame while slowly rotating the cylinder
all the time. It is very important
that the gas flame should not spread
over the surface of the glass, for it is
only the file mark that should be
heated. A mere glancing touch is sufficient.
Usually the glass will crack
off in a very clean cut.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes a fine platinum wire is
wound around in the file mark and
heated by an electric current. Less
common is the trick of wrapping a
strand of yarn soaked in turpentine
around the mark and burning it. The
principle is the same in each case. The
unequal heating of the glass causes it
to break.&mdash;Contributed by Harry H.

To Clean Painted or Frescoed Walls
</h2>


<p>
Use a paste made of vinegar and
baking soda with a small amount of
salt added. The ingredients should be
mixed in a large dish and applied to
the wall with a cloth. The grease and
fly specks as well as the carbon deposits
from kitchen smoke are quickly
removed. The mixture is harmless.
After the wall is thoroughly cleaned,
it should be washed with warm water
and soap, then dried with a cloth.
The mixture works equally well on
enameled baths and glass or white porcelain.

Securing Papers in a Mailing Tube

The illustrations show two methods
of securing papers or photographs in
a mailing tube. In Fig.&nbsp;1 the mailing
tube A is shown in cross section and
the manner of running the string
through the pasteboard walls illustrated.
The ends of the string are
drawn up and tied over or under the
label. If the label is pasted over the
string or string ends as they are tied,
it makes a sealed package which is
rated as first-class matter.

Cooling Tube for a Laboratory Still

<p>
A simple and very effective device
to replace the cumbersome cooling or
condensation coil of a still for the
amateur's laboratory can be easily
made as follows:
</p>

<p>
Procure an ordinary straight glass
tube of fairly large diameter and heat
it in the flame of an alcohol lamp with
the use of a blowpipe or in a Bunsen
burner with a very reduced flame so
that only a small spot of the tube is
brought to a red heat at one time
Then, with a previously pointed and
charred stick of wood&mdash;a penholder
for instance&mdash;produce a small recess
in the wall by pushing the charred
end gently into the glowing part of
the tube. This procedure is repeated
until the whole tube is thus provided
with small recesses. The indentations
should be made in spiral lines around
the tube, thus increasing the surface
that is in contact with the cooling
water. The operation of making the
recesses is shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. The walls
of the recesses should have a regular
and uniform slant.

vessel, for fractional distillation because
it will allow the most volatile
parts to pass out first, or as a condenser
(Fig.&nbsp;3), the arrangement of
which needs no explanation. The
amateur will find it much easier to
make this tube than to coil a very long one.

<p>
A durable brush for cleaning upholstered

following manner: Procure a piece of
haircloth, which is made of horsehair
woof and linen warp. Strips of haircloth,
cut lengthwise and 1-3/4&nbsp;in. wide,
are laid out smooth on a table and a
strip of wrapping paper, 1/2&nbsp;in. wide,
is firmly glued to one edge. When
this has dried, take out the warp that
is not covered by the paper. Brush
the fringe of horsehair until it is
straight and even, and before commencing
to wind, measure 6&nbsp;in. from
one end and glue this portion to the
side of a strip of soft wood, 6&nbsp;in. long,
5/8&nbsp;in. wide and 1/16&nbsp;in. thick. When
dry, wind the glued length of haircloth
and paper around the wood strip,
applying glue to each separate turn
of winding. The turns should be kept
flush on the side that has been glued
and the fringed part brushed and straight.

The part to be glued to the handle
must be perfectly even in its windings
and held firmly in place while the
glue is hardening. The winding should
be continued until the brush is 1-1/2&nbsp;in. thick.
</p>

<p>
The handle is made of a piece of
wood, 14&nbsp;in. long, 1-3/4&nbsp;in. wide and 1/2&nbsp;in. thick. Wood that takes a cherry

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>[189]</a></span>
which the brush is to be attached must
be given a light coat of glue. When
that has dried, glue the back of the
brush to it, and after the glue has hardened,
glue a piece of gimp around the
brush part, then drive upholsterers'
tacks into the gimp and wood, 3/4&nbsp;in.

<h2>
Removing Calcium Deposits on Glass
</h2>


<p>
A good way to clean glass vessels
in which hard water is boiled is to
use the following mixture to remove
not only the calcium deposits, but also
rust or sulphur stains that may be
present. The solution is a mixture of
ammonia water and a few ounces of
salt. This should be placed in the
glass vessel and boiled until the
deposits disappear. The ammonia
water may be made of any strength by
diluting if necessary.

When making long cuts with a cold

use a guide, as shown in the sketch.
The guide is made of a piece of wood,
about 1&nbsp;ft. long and 1-1/2&nbsp;in. wide. A
slot is cut in the center, wide enough
to receive the chisel edge snugly, and
about 9&nbsp;in. long. The guide is clamped

</div>

<p>
When laying aside paintbrushes, the
usual custom is to
place them in water
and then forget all
about them until
needed again, with
the result that the
water usually is
found more or less
evaporated and the
brushes hardened. If
a quantity of oil, A,
is poured on the
water B, it will prevent
this evaporation
and keep the brushes in good shape.

The sketch shows how to place an
ordinary sponge in a pump spout, to
filter out sand and dirt particles that
may come up with the water as it
is pumped. A wire is fastened in
the sponge so
that it can be
easily taken out
for washing.
When washing
the sponge give
the pump handle
a few strokes so that the dirt collected
in the spout will be washed out. Do
not press the sponge too tightly into
the spout, as this will stop the flow of
water.&mdash;Contributed by Chas. Homewood,

<h2>
Brown Stain for Wood
</h2>


<p>
Bichromate of potassium gives a
lustrous, rich, light to dark brown stain
on woods. The crystals are first dissolved
into a saturated solution, which
is then diluted with water. The stained
surface needs no rubbing, as the stain
leaves the wood perfectly clear for
any desired finish. The satinlike appearance
of wood treated by this stain
cannot be produced with any of the
pigment stains.&mdash;Contributed by August Meyer.

<h2>
An Egg Boiler
</h2>


<p>
In boiling eggs the usual method of
dropping the eggs from a spoon into
the boiling water often results in a
burn, as well as in cracking of the eggs
by the fall. In removing the eggs
from the hot water and taking one out
at a time, no two will be cooked alike.
To overcome these difficulties I constructed
an egg boiler as illustrated.

</div>

<p>
A pan was procured&mdash;tin or aluminum
as desired&mdash;about 1&nbsp;in. deep and
5-1/2&nbsp;in. in diameter, and holes were
drilled in the bottom having dimensions
as shown. A handle was attached
to the center with washers and
nuts. The small ends of the eggs are
set in the 1-3/8-in. holes and the whole
pan set in a vessel of boiling water.
When the boiling is completed, the
entire lot of eggs are removed at the
same time. As the device with its
load of cooked eggs is quite pleasing
in appearance, it may be set on a plate
and the eggs served from it on the
table.&mdash;Contributed by W. E. Crane, Cleveland, O.

<h2>
Removing Black Deposit an Bathtubs
</h2>


<p>
A good way to remove the black
deposit left on bathtubs by the water
is to use a strong solution of sulphuric
acid. The acid should be poured on
the discolored enameled surface and
washed around with a cloth. The acid
should not touch the hands so it is best
to use a stick to move the cloth.
Neither should it be allowed to touch
the metal parts, but if this happens, no
harm will result if it is quickly rubbed
off with a cloth and water then applied.
</p>

<p>
In using this acid never pour water
into the acid, but always pour the acid
into the water.&mdash;Contributed by Loren

<h2>
A Stocking-Stretcher Form
</h2>


<p>
A simple as well as inexpensive
device for preventing the shrinking of
stockings, more particularly those of
children, after they have been washed,
thus saving great wear and tear on the
fabrics and increasing their length of
life, is shown in the illustration. The
stretcher can be made by anyone, a
knowledge of woodcraft or art being
unnecessary. If used, the device will
prove to effect quite a saving in
money, labor and worry in the course
of a year.

Place a new and unused stocking,
that properly fits the foot, flat on a
heavy piece of cardboard or a wood
board, if desired, and mark an outline
of the stocking on the board with a
pencil. Cut out the design with a penknife
or heavy pair of scissors and
smooth the edges. A design having
the same shape and size as the stocking
results. Duplicate boards can be
easily made. Place a spool, such as
used to hold the finest silk thread, near
the upper end of the first form and on
top of this place the second. Then
drive a nail through the boards and
spool and clinch it, or better still, use
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>[191]</a></span>
a small bolt. When the stockings are
washed and the dampness wrung out
as well as possible, stretch them over
the boards and hang them up to dry.
They will retain their shape and are
easily ironed.&mdash;Contributed by Wm.

Stick Holder for a Chopping Block
</h2>


<p>
Having a lot of branch wood, from
1/2&nbsp;in. to 1&nbsp;in. in diameter, to saw, and
not wishing to bother with a sawbuck,
I rigged up a chopping block, as shown
in the sketch, by fastening a piece of
board to one side of the block with
small lag screws. The piece to be
sawed was laid across the block in the
notch. If the piece is held down on
the block with one foot, the wood is
very easily sawn.&mdash;Contributed by

Cleaning Gold and Platinum

<p>
A good way to clean gold or platinum
jewelry is to first brush with
soapsuds, then dust magnesia powder
over the article and allow it to dry. A
few rubs with a cloth makes the
article shine with great luster. As
magnesia powder is highly inflammable,
it must be kept away from fire.

<h2>
A Twine Spool
</h2>


<p>
The pieces of twine used in tying
parcels delivered to a residence are
either thrown away or tied together
and wound into a ball for future use.
The method I use for keeping the
pieces of twine is to wind them over
a discarded photographic-film spool.
The spool was slipped on a finishing
nail driven into the wall. The crank
for turning the spool was made of a
piece of wire, bent as shown and slipped
into the slot end of the spool. One
end of the first piece of string was tied
to the core and then wound around it,
the next piece tied to the first and
wound up, and so on, as the strings
were taken from the packages from
time to time. When a string is needed
for any purpose I always know where
to find it, and it is easier to take it
from the spool than from a ball.&mdash;Contributed

Embossed-leather-board chair bottoms

soft rags or fine shavings, then nail a
1/4-in. wood bottom over the filling

Closet Holders for Linen

A combination drawer and shelf for
a linen closet is much better than a
shelf or a drawer. It is constructed
in the manner of a drawer with sides
and a back, the front being open and
the ends of the sides cut rounding. A
clip is attached to the under side of
the bottom, near the front edge, to
provide a means for pulling out the holder.

Sheets, towels, table cloths, napkins,
etc., can be neatly piled on the
holder and can be seen without digging
down to the bottom. It has the
advantage over the shelf that it can
be pulled out without anything falling
off, and the linen on the back part
can be easily reached as well as that
in front. The closet may contain as
many holders as is necessary and
should be provided with a door for

<h2>
Preserving Dry Batteries

<p>
The life of dry batteries, which are
to be used in wet or damp places, may
be considerably lengthened by being
treated in the following manner:
</p>

<p>
The batteries are placed in glass jars
a little wider and higher than themselves.
A layer of dry sawdust is
placed in the bottom, for the battery
to rest on, and the sides are packed
with sawdust to within 1/2&nbsp;in. of the
top. Waterproof wires are connected
to the binding posts and melted
paraffin poured over the battery to the
top of the jar. The carbon and zinc
terminals should be marked to avoid
trouble when connecting several cells
together. Batteries treated in this
manner are waterproof and can be
submerged in water if necessary.&mdash;Contributed

line, A, on each side.
These lines should be at
least 1/8&nbsp;in. wide. Place

<h2>
Mending a Break in Felt
</h2>


<p>
A good way to mend partially
broken felt or a felt hat is to hold a
lighted match under the break and
smooth out the crevice with the
hand. The shellac in the felt is melted
by the heat and runs together, mending
the felt in such a way that the
break is hardly noticeable. This
method may also be used to mend felt
articles in the laboratory.

Imitating Ebony on Oak
</h2>


<p>
The wood is immersed for 48 hours
in a warm solution of alum and
sprinkled several times with the following
mixture: One part of logwood
of the best quality is boiled with 10
parts of water, then it is filtered
through linen and the liquid evaporated
at a low temperature until its
volume is reduced by one-half. To
every quart of this bath are added 10
to 15 drops of a saturate of soluble
indigo entirely neutral in reaction.
</p>

<p>
Smaller pieces may be steeped for a
time in this solution, then the wood is
rubbed with a saturated and filtered
solution of verdigris in warm, concentrated
acetic acid, and this operation
continued until a black color of the
desired intensity is obtained. The oak
wood dyed in this manner is very similar
to real ebony.

tongue with a coil spring so that it
will be kept in a vertical position. The
tongue is always out of the way when
it is not used for drawing the wagon.
The spring is only strong enough to
hold the tongue, so that when this is
used for pulling there is little or no
tendency of the spring to draw the
tongue upward. The coil spring is
fastened with one screweye in the
tongue and one in the front axle.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Gluing Small Mitered Frames
</h2>


<p>
The mechanic who attempts to fasten
a mitered frame in the home workshop
usually comes to grief. This is
due to lack of proper facilities for holding
the frame straight and out of wind,
and for clamping or drawing the miter
joint together after the glue has been
applied. The little device shown in
the sketch, if properly made and used,
does away with the usual difficulties
and annoyances. It consists of a triangular
block of wood with raised
strips on the two edges that make the
right angle, and the clamping piece
with the wood screw through the center
on the long side. The raised strips
are made somewhat thinner than the
frame to be fastened, as the clamping
piece should bear on the frame and not
on the strips; the function of the strips
being to hold the frame square. The
triangular block should be large
enough to take the corner of the frame
and leave room enough for the wood
screw that holds it in place on the
block. Four of these blocks will be
necessary and they should be used in
conjunction with pinch dogs. These
dogs come in different sizes and may
be purchased at supply stores or made
as shown. The outside of the legs
should be straight and parallel and the
inside tapered so as to draw the joint together.

reason I constructed a special line for
the small goods. A line was cut to
fit between two porch posts and a hook
made of galvanized wire tied to each
end, staples being driven into the posts
to receive them. Three or four wire
grips were formed and attached to the
line. It was only necessary to draw
the corner of a handkerchief into the
grip as it was wrung out, placing several
in each grip. The line with its
load was then carried out and attached
between the porch posts. This made
it unnecessary to look through the
clothes for the small articles. It also
prevented chilling the fingers and no
pins were needed.&mdash;Contributed by

Automatically Controlled Ice-Box Lights
</h2>


<p>
Often the ice box is placed in a dark
closet or some out-of-the-way place,
and it is almost impossible to locate
articles already in the box or put
others away without considerable inconvenience
on account of the lack of
proper light. This difficulty can be
easily overcome by mounting a small
electric lamp in each of the different
compartments of the box, which will
be automatically lighted when the lid
of the box is raised or the door opened.
The circuit through the lamp is controlled
by a special switch mounted in
such a way that its contacts are open
when the doors and lid of the box are
closed. A diagram of the circuit is
given in Fig.&nbsp;1, which shows three
lamps, each controlled by a separate
switch, connected in parallel to a battery
of several dry cells. The lamps
should be of low voltage and need not
be very high in candlepower. The
number of cells needed in the battery
will depend upon the voltage of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>[195]</a></span>
lamps. The voltage of the battery and
the rated voltage of the lamps should
be approximately the same.

A special switch that will serve the
above purpose is shown in Fig.&nbsp;2. It
consists of two pieces of spring brass,
A and B, about 3/8&nbsp;in. wide, bent into
the forms shown. These pieces are
mounted in a recess cut in the jamb of
the door or lid in such a way that the
free end of the piece A is held away
from the piece B when the door or lid
is closed. When the lid of the box or
the door is open the two springs come
in contact and the lamp lights; upon
closing the lid or door the contact is
broken and the lamp goes out.

<p>
A good quality of rubber-insulated
copper wire should be used in making
the connections, and all parts should
be as well protected from moisture
and the possibilities of mechanical
abuse as possible. It would be best to
tape the lamps in the sockets with a
piece of friction tape so as to prevent
moisture getting into the socket and,
perhaps, shortening the lamp. A short
piece of brass tubing can be mounted
around the lamp to protect it mechanically.

<h2>
A Grass Rake
</h2>


<p>
This adaptation of an ordinary iron
rake for use on a lawn was the outcome
of not having a lawn rake at hand.
Two spools, each 1-1/2&nbsp;in. in diameter,
were procured and one forced on each
end tooth of the rake. The spools were
forced on the teeth just far enough to
allow the rake to slide on the ground
and prevent the other teeth from digging
out the grass. The end of the
spools may be rounded and smoothed
so that they will slide easily on the
ground.&mdash;Contributed by H. E. Gray, Montclair, N. J.

quickly
without being

<h2>
Making Small Taps
</h2>

<p>
The owner of a private workshop has
need for taps and occasionally wishes
to make them, not because they are
cheaper, but for the sake of experience
or to get some special thread. In cutting
the flutes, whether it be by hand or
in a shaper, it is a good plan to give the
flutes an angle, that is, to cut them, not
parallel with the axis of the tap, but at
an angle of 5 to 15&nbsp;deg. with the center
line. This makes the tap cut easier,
giving it a wedge action instead of just
simply pushing the metal off. The
same method applies to counterbores
and countersinks, which, when so
made, take less power to drive.

Sink a Substitute for a Dishpan

</div>

<p>
On special occasions when company
is entertained or in large families, it is
almost impossible to wash all the
dishes in an ordinary
dishpan;
in fact, the large
platters will not
go in at all, so I
devised the following
method
as a substitute
for a larger pan.
A tin disk was
cut from the top
of a tomato can with a can opener so as
to be as round as possible, then a piece
of cheesecloth was folded into an even
square, the disk placed in the center
and all four corners of the cloth drawn
over to the center of the disk. A nail
was driven through the center of the
disk, to make a hole, through which
a string was drawn with the nail and
tied to it to form a loop on the head.
This is used to stop the sink drain.
</p>

<p>
When this is put over the drain outlet
the sink may be used as a dishpan.
The same result could be obtained a
little better with a piece of an old rubber
boot or rubber coat, but usually
this material is not at hand, and the
cheesecloth will do almost as well.&mdash;Contributed

How to Make Small Coil Springs

<p>
Procure a nut, having a small thread
that will admit the size of the wire to
be used in making the spring. Cut a
small notch to the depth of the thread
where the thread starts, and procure a
smooth rod that will pass snugly
through the threads of the nut. Shape
one end of the rod to fit a carpenter's
brace, if there is no drill chuck at hand,
and drill a hole in the other end to
admit one end of the spring wire.

Bend the wire at right angles and

be gripped in a vise, and turn the rod,
at the same time seeing that the wire
is guided into the notch cut at the start
of the thread. The wire will follow the
thread of the nut and make a perfect
spring of an even opening throughout
its length. Closed or open coils can be
made by using a nut having the proper

The double-edged pruning saw with
coarse teeth on one side and fine on the

if it were not for the fact that the unused
edge so often injures the bark of
the trunk when the saw is being used.
A very satisfactory guard may be
quickly made of a brass curtain rod

and cutting a suitable length to fit over
the edge, as shown in the sketch. This

Home-Made Motion-Picture Camera and Projector<br />
By Charles Frank
</h2>
<h3>In Three Parts&mdash;Part I</h3>


<div class='img' id='img198b'>
  <img src='images/img198b.png'

  <p>(Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
Motion pictures are made and reproduced
by means of a camera and projector,
each having a similar mechanism
that would seem entirely too complicated
for the
average person
to construct at
home, yet a correspondent
of the
Nickelodeon
has devised
a simple
rotary cylinder
shutter that can
be substituted
for the complicated
parts.
While this simple
cylinder
shutter is not
claimed to be
infringing
on existing patents, yet, as it has no
commercial value, there would be no
objection on this score. The instruments
described are nothing more than
toys, and if the amateur photographer
can secure a few dozen feet of animated
photographs about the home
that are dear to his heart, and reproduce
them on a screen, it will have
served its purpose. The camera and
projector described uses standard film,
1-3/8&nbsp;in. wide, with perforations every 3/16&nbsp;in.
</p>


<h3>
The Camera
</h3>

<p>
The ordinary hand camera for making
still pictures consists of a light-tight
box with a lens at one end and a
sensitized plate or film at the other.
The motion-picture camera (Fig.&nbsp;1) is
nothing more than a hand camera with
a mechanical device for stepping a long
roll of film through a space in the focal
plane of the lens at a speed of about 16
pictures a second, and stopping the
film long enough to make the requisite
exposure on each division. The first
thing to consider is the lens. A lens
having ordinary speed for a hand camera,
and one with about 3&nbsp;in. focal
length will give satisfactory results.
If one does not care to purchase a lens,
a small 1-1/2&nbsp;in. or 2&nbsp;in. reading glass can
be used, if it is stopped down, or a lens
may be taken from a hand camera.
The width of the camera from front to
back (W, Fig.&nbsp;2) must be determined
by the focal length of the lens. The
dimensions given in the drawing are
only approximate, and they can be
changed if the camera is to be used in
making an extra long film negative.
</p>

<p>
The roll of unexposed film (A, Fig.
2) is placed on a small shaft between
U-shaped bearings, made of sheet metal
and screwed to the top board of the
camera. The lens B is set in the front
board at a point 4&nbsp;in. below the top. If
a large roll of film is to be used, this
distance must be greater to allow room
for the film roll in the top of the camera.
The cylinder C, which acts as a
shutter and intermittent movement, revolves
directly behind and in the path
of the light passing through the lens.
Partitions, DD, are set in grooves cut
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>[199]</a></span>
in the boards, forming the sides of the
camera. These partitions are to keep
the light, which may be diffused from
the lens, from striking the film at either
side of the shutter, and at the same
time acting as guides for the film at the
rear end of the camera. Their edges
at the back are covered with black velvet.
The back of the box is a hinged
door, rabbeted on all edges, and opening
at the side to allow the insertion
and removal of the film, and also acting
as a guide for the film when closed.
A strip of black velvet, E, a little wider
than the film, is pasted to the inside
surface of the door, so that it bears
lightly against the back edges of the
partitions DD. The film passes between
the edges of the partitions and
the velvet on the door with some friction,
which keeps it from moving except
when pulled through with the
roller shutter. A wire-staple guide,
F, is fastened in the lower partition,
through which the end of the film is
passed before closing the door. The
film as it is run through drops in folds
in the bottom of the box.

  </a>
  <p>Fig.&nbsp;2&mdash;Details of Camera</p>
</div>

<p>
The rotary cylinder shutter is the
heart of the machine and should be
made well and strictly according to the
dimensions. The detail of this part is
shown in Fig.&nbsp;3. A rectangular opening
is mortised through one of its
diameters to admit light on the film
when in certain positions. The cylinder
is of wood with a 1/4&nbsp;in. steel rod
inserted in the center of each end for
axles. A small grooved pulley (G, Fig.
2), about 1&nbsp;in. in diameter, is fastened
to the outer end of one of these rods.
The cylinder is revolved by a round
belt from a drive wheel, H, 3 or 3-1/2&nbsp;in.
in diameter and turned by the aid of a
crankpin. Owing to the backward rotation
of the cylinder, the belt must be
crossed between the drive wheel H,
and the pulley G. The projections or
sprockets, Fig.&nbsp;3, must be accurately
set at a distance of 3/8&nbsp;in. from the 90&nbsp;deg.
point, using the center of the mortised
hole as a base. These projections
can be pins or small staples, but
they must not be over 1/16&nbsp;in. in size.
The base of the sprockets must fit the
hole in the film snugly, but the points
should be slightly rounding, so that
they will easily enter the perforations.
When the upper sprocket, which is approaching
the film, engages a perforation,
just below the upper partition, it
will carry the film downward until the
sprocket disengages from the perforation
at the lower partition. The distance
of travel must be exactly 3/4&nbsp;in.,
as that is the height of each picture.
The cylinder requires some adjustment
to meet this condition; therefore the
axles are made to revolve in holes
bored in two strips of wood, JJ, which
can be moved forward or backward to
obtain the proper distance from the film.
To allow for this movement, the axles
pass through slots cut in the sides of
the camera box instead of round holes.
The strips JJ are fastened temporarily
and when the correct position for the
cylinder is found, they are permanently
fastened to the box. Grooves, K, are
cut through the black velvet and into
the back of the door to allow a space
for the sprockets to pass through freely.
The inside of the box should be painted
a dead black, and black paper pasted
on all corners and joints. Black velvet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>[200]</a></span>
is pasted in the rabbet of the door to
insure a light-tight joint when the door
is closed. The cylinder shutter is also
painted a dead black inside and out.

  <p>Fig.&nbsp;3&mdash;Details of Shutter</p>
</div>

<p>
The cylinder in revolving exposes the
film immediately behind it through the
mortised hole. The sprockets or cylinder
does not touch the film while the
exposure is being made, but as the hole
turns toward a perpendicular position,
the sprockets catch the perforations of
the film and it moves down 3/4&nbsp;in. Just
as soon as the sprockets disengage the
film, the shutter exposes the next section
of film, and so on as rapidly as
the cylinder is turned, but the average
should be about 16 pictures per second.
A view finder must be supplied so
the field covered by the lens can be determined.
Such a finder is made of
two pieces of metal, L and M, bent L-shaped
and fastened to the top of the
camera box. One of the pieces (L)
has a rectangular opening 1&nbsp;in. wide
and 3/4&nbsp;in. high, and the other (M) is
drilled with a 1/8&nbsp;in. drill, the distance
between the two pieces being the focal
length of the lens. One eye applied
to the 1/8&nbsp;in. hole in the piece M will
see through the rectangular hole in the
piece L about the same field as covered
by the lens. The pieces should be accurately
placed and fastened on the
box when the camera is set, so that the
lens will throw the same portion of the
picture on the space where the film
passes as will be seen through the finder.

a piece of burlap or other strong material
was nailed across the center with
slack enough for it to be partially submerged.

Assemble the rod and bore small
holes through the brass sockets into the

also act as guides for the line. Should

</h2>


<h3>
Developing
</h3>

<p>
After having exposed the film in the
camera, the next steps are to develop
and make a positive film from the negative.
The developing and exposing of
the film for the positive are the same
as in ordinary photography for making
negatives and lantern slides, the only
difference being in the apparatus for
handling the long films. One of the
simplest ways of developing a long
film is to use a large tray in connection
with a cross arm having upright pins
around which the film is wrapped in
a continuous spiral. A film 100&nbsp;ft. long
would require a tray 18 by 22&nbsp;in., with
pins set in the cross arm about 3/8&nbsp;in.
apart. This method of developing is
shown in Fig.&nbsp;4.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img202a'>
  <img src='images/img202a.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Fig.&nbsp;4&mdash;Cross Arms with Pins</p>
</div>

<p>
A long film can be developed in a
small tray by using two flanged wheels
or spools mounted on a frame (Fig.&nbsp;5)
that holds them directly above the
liquid in the tray. The spools have a
wood core or center with metal sides of
sufficient diameter to take in the length
of film to be developed. One end of
the undeveloped film is attached to one
spool and then wound upon it, then the
other end is passed through the guides,
gelatine side down, and fastened to the
other spool. The film is first run
slowly through a water bath until it is
thoroughly saturated, then it is passed
through the developing solution again
and again until the proper density is secured.
The trays can be easily removed
and others substituted for fixing,
washing, hardening and soaking, the
film being passed through each solution
in the same manner. Before developing
either negative or positive film,
small test strips should be run through
the solution so that the proper timing
and treating of the full-length strip will
correspond to the test strip.

  <p>Fig.&nbsp;5&mdash;Developing Long Films</p>
</div>

<p>
A reel should be prepared for drying
the film. This can be made of small
slats placed around two disks to form
a drum (Fig.&nbsp;6) about 1-1/2&nbsp;ft. in diameter
and 2-1/2&nbsp;ft. long. After the film has
been passed through the various solutions
and is ready for drying, it is
wound spirally around on the slats with
the gelatine side out, and the whole
hung up to dry.

<h3>
Printing
</h3>

<p>
The printing to make the transparency
is accomplished by a very simple
arrangement. The negative and positive
films must be drawn through a

The sprocket A is placed directly
back of the opening B which may be
regulated to admit the proper light.
The sprocket can be purchased from a
moving-picture stock house cheaply,
but if the builder so desires, one can be
made from wood turned up about 1&nbsp;in.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>[203]</a></span>
in diameter, or so that the circumference
will receive sprockets at points 3/16&nbsp;in. apart. The sprockets are made of
metal pins driven into the wood. Two
rows of them are placed around the
wood cylinder about 1-1/8&nbsp;in. apart.
</p>

<p>
The cylinder is provided with a small
metal shaft at each end which turns
in round holes or bearings in the sides
of the box. One of the shafts should
project through the side of the box and
have a grooved wheel, C, attached.
The sprocket cylinder is driven by a
smaller grooved wheel or pulley, D, to
which a crank is attached for turning.
The relative sizes of these wheels are
determined by the speed of the exposure
and the kind of light used. A 3-in.
or 4-in. wheel on the cylinder sprocket
shaft, driven by a pulley about 1&nbsp;in. in
diameter, will be suitable under ordinary
circumstances. The opening B
may be adjusted by two metal slides
which fit tightly in metal grooves fastened
to the wood front. The metal
grooves and slides can be made of tin
and painted a dead black. The films
after passing over the sprocket, fall
into the bottom of the box, or, if very
long films are to be made, the instrument
can be used in the dark room and
the light admitted only to the opening
B, then the ends can be dropped into a
basket or other receptacle at the bottom
and the unprinted portions carried
on reels above the box.
</p>

<p>
The speed of the exposure and the
width of the opening B can be determined
by making test strips. This can
be done by setting the opening B to a
certain width and turning the crank for
10 or 15 seconds and counting the number
of revolutions. The proper exposure
can be easily attained by this method.

<p>
The film positives are projected on
a screen with the same kind of a lantern
as is used for lantern slides, with
the addition of the device for stepping
the film through, one picture at a time,
and flashing light on each picture as
it remains stationary for an instant.
The projector (Fig.&nbsp;8) is composed of
a lamp house, a condensing lens to
make the beam of light converge upon
the film for illuminating it evenly,
a film-stepping device, and a projecting
lens for throwing the enlarged picture
of the illuminated film upon a screen.

  <p>Fig.&nbsp;8&mdash;Projector Complete</p>
</div>

<p>
The lamp house is made of ordinary
stovepipe metal and the dimensions
given in the sketch are for a size suitable
to use an acetylene or gas burner.
The metal is laid out as shown by the
pattern (Fig.&nbsp;9) and bent on the dotted
lines to form the sides
and ends of the house.
The joint may be riveted,
or, if taken to
a tinshop, lock-seamed.
The cover is cut out as
shown, the sides and ends
having bent holes which
are covered on the inside
with perforated sheet
metal, A. In order to deflect
the light, a small angular
strip, B, is riveted
on so that its upper portion will cover
the holes and allow a space for the heat
to pass out. The cover may be hinged
or set on like a cover on a can. The lamp
house is attached to a sliding wood base
for adjusting its position on the baseboard.

This can be made of the same material
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>[205]</a></span>

can be rolled and a lock joint made at
a local tinshop, or the pieces shaped

  <p>Fig.&nbsp;10&mdash;Details of the Lamp, Stepping Device and Base</p>
</div>

<p>
An ordinary mantle or acetylene
burner is attached to a gas pipe that
has for its base a drop elbow fastened
to a sliding board similar to the slide of
the lamp house on the baseboard. A
good reflector should be attached to a
standard just back of the burner. The
standard is also fastened to the sliding
board. The proper distance of the
light from the condensing lens can be
easily set by this adjusting device.
This arrangement is shown in Fig.&nbsp;10&nbsp;in the diagram entitled "lamp parts."
</p>

<p>
The device for stepping the film is
a duplicate of the one used in the camera
as described in Part I, with the exception
of the lens. The lens should
be about 2&nbsp;in. in diameter with such
a focal length that will give a picture
of the required size, or a lens of 12-in.
focus enlarging a 1-in. film to about 6&nbsp;ft. at a distance of 24&nbsp;ft. A regular
lens fitted in a metal tube can be purchased
from a moving-picture stock
house at a reasonable price. The box
is made up similar to the camera box,
but with a metal back instead of the
wood. The intense heat from the light
would quickly burn the wood and for
this reason the light should be kept
from the film while it is not in motion.
The projecting lens barrel should be
fitted snugly, yet loose enough for focusing.
</p>

<p>
The baseboard is cut as shown and
the film-stepping device is firmly attached
to the small end. The sides extend
over the baseboard and are fastened
with screws and braced with
metal brackets. The slot in the small
end of the baseboard is for the film to
pass through. The film should have a
tension the same as in the camera with
velvet placed on the edges of the partitions.
It is well to have a guide below
the roller shutter to keep the film
from encircling the roller as it turns.

<h2>
Homemade Graining Tools
</h2>


<p>
Desiring to do some fancy graining
and having no tools at hand, I hastily
made two of them from pieces of garden
hose, as shown in the sketch. Two
pieces were cut from the hose, each 5&nbsp;in. long, and the first one made as follows:
A small hole, about 1/4&nbsp;in. in
diameter, was cut through the outside
layer of rubber with a sharp knife at
two points on opposite sides of the hose
and exactly in the center for length.
Around these holes rings of the rubber
were cut out, or rather peeled off from
the canvas part, the rings being 3/16&nbsp;in.
wide, and the grooves, or parts removed,
also 3/16&nbsp;in. wide. The hose will
then appear as shown in the upper
left-hand corner of the sketch.

To use this grainer, first paint the
ground color, using a buff tint for imitation
light oak, and allow it to dry,
then put on a light coat of raw sienna,
and while wet, take the prepared hose
and draw it slowly over the length of
wood, at the same time revolving the
grainer slowly.
</p>

<p>
The other piece of hose, at the other
corner, is made to take the place of a
steel graining comb. The rubber is cut
away lengthwise, leaving four segments,
about 4&nbsp;in. wide, on four sides
of the hose. These segments are then
notched out, like threads on a tap, each
segment having a different number to
the inch. These are used in the same
manner as steel combs.&mdash;Contributed

Needle for Repairing Screens

<p>
In attaching patches to window or
door screens, the work requires a continual
shifting from one side to the
other, or two persons, one on each side,
must be present to pass the threaded
needle back and forth. The operation
can be easily simplified by using a
bent needle, which has been heated
and suitably shaped. The point of
this needle can always be made to return
to the side from which it entered,
thereby avoiding the need of an assistant
or the tiresome shifting back
and forth.&mdash;Contributed by G. Jaques, Chicago, Ill.

Mechanical Aid to Singers

<p>
Procure a large cigar box, of the
square variety, and three ordinary
drinking glasses with very thin walls
and of different sizes, and place them
in the box, as follows: Space them
evenly, and drive three brads close to
the circumference of each glass bottom,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>[207]</a></span>
so that the glasses will have to be
forced in between them. To prevent
the glasses from touching the wood
place a one-cent piece under each one.
</p>

<p>
A fourth glass is used, but from this
the bottom must be removed. This
can be done by saturating a string, or
piece of yarn, in kerosene oil, wrapping
it once around the glass near the bottom,
then lighting it and allowing the
string to burn out. The glass is then
quickly dropped into cold water, which
will remove the bottom.
</p>

<p>
A hole is cut in the cover of the box
to receive the bottomless glass from
the upper side, so that its lower edge
will be flush with the under surface.
Cut a slot, 3&nbsp;in. long and 1/8&nbsp;in. wide,
in the cover near the back side.
</p>

<p>
To use, close the cover and at a distance
of about 1/2&nbsp;in. from the glass in
the cover, or mouthpiece, sing into it.

Adjustable Film-Developing Machine
</h2>


<p>
The simple homemade developing
machine, shown in the illustration, can
be easily made with three film spools,
some strong wire, and odd pieces of
wood. It consists of an open frame,
having two side pieces provided with
slots down the center, sufficiently wide
to allow an ordinary wood screw, of
suitable size, to slide up or down freely.
The two end-connecting pieces act as
supports for the developing tray and
should be made of sufficient length so
the tray can pass freely between the
sliding upright frame, made to fit in
between the side pieces of the base.
This frame can be adjusted to suit the
length of film and is clamped in place
at the desired position by wood screws,
fitting in the long notches and screwed
into the uprights. The two bottom
rollers consist of film spools which are
fastened in place by being slipped over
a suitable wire, bent so the spool can
enter the developing tray and the wire
pass over the sides. Another bend at
the outer end provides for the adjustment
of the spools and for securing the
wire in place by staples. The top spool
is secured to a wire fitted with a crank
at the outer end, so that in turning the
wire, the spool will also turn, thereby
driving the film. When placing the
film on the machine, the sensitive side
should face outward so it will not rub
against the spools. The ends of the
film may be connected with pins or
ordinary paper fasteners.&mdash;Contributed

Preventing Loss of Fish from Covered Baskets

<p>
In the cover of fish baskets an opening
is frequently made permitting the
fish to be put in without lifting the
cover. In traveling over rough places,
or when the basket is full, some of the
fish are likely to be shaken out, or may
wiggle out of the basket. To guard
against this, a leather flap can be provided
covering the hole on the inside.
At one end of the flap, four holes
should be punched. It can then be
placed in position and securely laced
to the cover. The flap acts as a valve,
allowing fish to be put into the basket,
but preventing their escape.&mdash;Contributed

and the Metal Bracket That Makes a Bearing for the Revolving Wheel,
Having Openings Covered with Tinted Celluloid</p>
</div>

<p>
The metal necessary can be the ordinary
stovepipe material, but if it is
desired to have a fine-appearing lantern,
procure what is called Russian
iron. This metal has a gloss, and if
used, it should be gone over from time
to time with a rag soaked in oil, then
wiped dry, to keep it from rusting.
The pattern for the body of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>[210]</a></span>

<p>
If metal, long enough for the whole
length, cannot be procured, then make it

end also on the second part, as shown
on the first, for a riveted joint. The
metal is bent on the dotted lines and
cut out on the full ones. The distance
between the lines A to be bent is equal
to the radius B. The part A forms the
sloping side of the top, and the 2-in.
part at the top of the side extends vertically
on the upper or vertical part,
it being 1/2&nbsp;in. narrower to provide an
outlet for the heat.
</p>

<p>
An opening is cut in the rear end,
as shown, also a hole, 5&nbsp;in. in diameter,
in the front end. The size of the round
hole is optional, as it should be cut
to suit the condensing lens provided.
If a lens 5 1/2&nbsp;in. in diameter is used,
then a 5-in. hole should be cut. This
is enough difference in size to hold
the lens from dropping through, while
clips riveted on the inside of the lamp-house
end will hold it in place. The
lens is set in the hole with the curved
side outward from the inside of the
lamp house.
</p>

<p>
The top, or covering, is cut out of the
same material as used in making the
lamp house, the length being 12&nbsp;in.,
and the sides are cut to extend 1/2&nbsp;in.
on each side of the ventilator. The
edges, being turned down on the dotted
lines, provide a covering to prevent any
great amount of light from passing out
through the 1/2-in. ventilating opening
mentioned in connection with the side
construction of the lantern. The 1-in.
parts of the cover ends are turned
down and riveted to the ends of the
lamp house. The little extensions on
the ends provide a means of riveting
the side, to make a solid joint.
</p>

<p>
The arm C is made of a piece of
1/8 or 3/16-in. metal, shaped as shown,
to fit on the corner of the lamp house,
where it is riveted. This provides a
support and a place for an axis for the
large revolving wheel holding the colored-celluloid disks.

cleats, nailed lengthwise to form a runway,
4&nbsp;in. wide, into which another
board is fitted to carry the burner.
While the illustration shows an acetylene
burner, any kind of light may be

During the summer these rats
build a shelter for the winter constructed
of moss and sticks placed on
the river or lake bed, the top extending
above the water level and the entrance
being through a hole in the
bottom near one side, while the passage
itself is under water. It, therefore,
only remains for the trapper to make
one of these houses over into a huge
wire trap so that the animal may be
caught alive.

<h2>
A Casein Glue
</h2>


<p>
Casein glues are splendid in woodworking,
making cardboard articles,
and when the composition is varied
somewhat, make excellent cements for
china and metals. Casein is made from
the curd of soured milk after removal
of the fat, and is put on the market in
the form of a dry powder.
</p>

<p>
To make the glue, soak the casein
powder two hours in an equal weight
of hot water. To this gummy mass add
about one-seventh the weight of the
casein in borax which has been dissolved
in very little hot water. Stir
until all is dissolved after mixing borax
and casein. This can be thinned with
water to suit and is a good glue, but
it can be made more adhesive by the
addition of a little sodium arsenate.
Any alkali, such as soda or ammonia,
could be substituted for the borax.
</p>

<p>
To make a china cement, lime or
water glass should be substituted for
the borax. Addition of burnt magnesia
increases the speed of hardening.

<h2>
The Mile-O-View Camera<br />
By T. B. Lambert
</h2>


<p>
Many have tried, but heretofore no
one has succeeded in taking panoramic
views from the side of fast-moving
trains or street cars. Motion pictures
are easily obtained from the front or
rear of moving trains, but none with
the camera lens pointing at right angles,
or nearly so, to the track. A complete
apparatus for taking continuous
and perfect panoramic pictures of any
desired length as one travels through
a country is too complicated to be described
in detail within the limits of
this article, but a simple arrangement,
invented and constructed by the writer,
will enable anyone to perform the experiment
at practically no cost except
for the film.
</p>

  <p>The Board Used Instead of a Tripod is Placed
across the Backs of Two Car Seats</p>
</div>

<p>
Some form of a roll-film camera is
essential, and simply as a working
basis, it will be assumed an ordinary
camera is used, post-card camera in
size, for which the following things
will be required: A piece of thin black
card, or hard rubber; a small board,
and a piece of wire to be used as a crank.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img213c'>
  <img src='images/img213c.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>These Two Articles Constitute the Only Parts
Necessary to Change a Camera into a Mile-O-View</p>
</div>

<p>
Prepare the paper, or hard rubber,
by cutting it to a size that will exactly
cover the rear camera opening when
the back of the camera is removed,
which, in the case of a post-card size,
is 6&nbsp;in. long and 3-3/4&nbsp;in. wide; then
cut a narrow slot, about 3/64&nbsp;in. wide
crosswise through the center of the material.
This slot should extend to
within about 1/2&nbsp;in. of each edge, and
the edges must be perfectly smooth
and straight. If paper is used, glue it
to the opening in the camera. If hard
rubber is used, it can be made up as
shown and set in the camera opening.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>[214]</a></span>
This will bring the slot directly back
of the lens center and at right angles
to the direction in which the film moves
when being rolled.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img214'>
  <img src='images/img214.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Two Parts as They are Applied to an Ordinary
Roll-Film Camera</p>
</div>

<p>
A board is prepared, about 4&nbsp;ft. long,
10&nbsp;in. wide and 3/4&nbsp;in. thick. This is to
take the place of a tripod, and it must
have a small hole and suitable wing
nut to attach the camera near the center.
This length of board will reach
from the back of one seat to another
when it is placed to support the camera
during the exposure.
</p>

<p>
A wire, about 1/8&nbsp;in. in diameter, is
bent, as shown, with a short hook on
one end, and the other turned up at
right angles, to serve as a handle. This
wire, when hooked into the wing nut,
will enable one to wind up the film at
a fairly uniform speed. This completes
all the necessary apparatus.
</p>

<p>
To take pictures with this panoramic
outfit, load the camera in the usual
way, but do not wind it up to exposure
No. 1; stop at a point where the beginning
of the film will be nearly opposite
the narrow slot in the black
paper, or rubber. This would be to
stop the turning at about the time the
hand pointer appears in the small back
window. Attach the camera firmly to
the board and brace up the lens end
so that it will not easily shake with
the movement of the car. Place the
board across the backs of two adjacent
seats, so that the camera will point out
of the window at exactly right angles
to the car.
</p>

<p>
When ready to expose, open the
shutter wide, turn the crank that is
hooked into the wing nut, and slowly
wind up the film while the train is
running. This will give a panoramic
picture, continuous in character, and if
the speed of turning is well judged,
some very splendid views can be made.
</p>

<p>
The speed of turning the crank will
be governed by the focal length of the
lens and the speed of the train. For
an average lens, the crank should be
given one turn per second when the
car is traveling about 15 miles an hour,
or the average speed of a street car,
A train traveling 30 miles an hour will
require two turns of the crank per
second. A good method of trying this
out is to use one film as a test and
turn the crank a few times and note
its speed by the second, then stop and
begin again at another speed for a few
turns and so on, until the entire film
is exposed, always noting the turns
and time for each change, also the
speed of the train. When the film is
developed the one that shows best will
give the proper number of turns per second.
</p>

<p>
The following points must be considered:
The track should not be rough,
and the camera must be perfectly
steady and not twisted out of position
by turning the crank, otherwise the
resulting picture will be wavy. If the
slot in the back board is not smooth
and true, the picture will be streaked.
Turning the film too fast will make the
picture elongated, and too slowly, condensed.
Should the camera be pointed
otherwise than at right angles the picture
will be distorted. This arrangement
cannot be used to take moving
objects except under special conditions.
A picture of a passing train of cars can
be made if the camera is stationary,
but the wheels and drive rods will appear
twisted out of shape. It is best
for the experimenter to confine himself
to scenery at the beginning, avoiding
architectural objects, because a variation
in speed of turning the crank to
wind the film naturally distorts the architecture,
which variation is not so
noticeable in a scenic view.

<h2>
A Photographic Worktable for Small Quarters<br />
By K. V. Reed
</h2>


<p>
Flat dwellers have no space at
their disposal for a person to work
at photography, and the bathroom
must take the place of a dark room.
As this was very inconvenient in my
case, I constructed a table, that from
all appearances was nothing more than
a large-size kitchen worktable, and
such a table can be used in case the
builder does not care to construct it.
</p>

<p>
The table is turned upside down and
the top removed by taking out the
screws. The top is made of several
pieces glued together and will remain
in one piece. It is then hinged at one
side to the top edge of the rail, so that
it can be turned back like a trunk, or
box, cover.
</p>

<p>
Boards are then nailed to the under
edge of the rails. If a very neat job is
required, these boards should be set
inside on strips nailed to the inside surfaces
of the rails, at the proper place
to make the boards come flush with the
under edges of the rails.
</p>

<p>
At the back side and in the center of
the new bottom, a hole is cut, 6 or 7&nbsp;in. square, and a box fastened beneath
it, to form a bottom several inches
below the main bottom. In this space
bottles filled with solutions are kept.
The main bottom should be painted
with an acid-proof varnish.
</p>

<p>
The space in the table is then
divided, and partitions set up, which
can be arranged to suit the builder.
</p>

<p>
Another attachment, which comes in
exceedingly handy, is the ruby light.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>[216]</a></span>
This consists of a box, large enough
to receive a printing frame at the bottom.
Two holes are cut in the table
top, at the right places to make a
window for the light and a slit for the
printing frame. When the table top
is raised, the box with the light is fastened
over the openings with hooks,
the arrangement of which will depend
on the size and shape of the box. In
closing, the lamp box is removed, and
pieces of board are set in the holes.
This can be easily arranged, if the holes
and blocks are cut on a slight slope,
so that the latter when set in will not
fall through the openings.

about 4&nbsp;in. square, tacked on the
ski and with the hair slanting backward.
This will not interfere with
going forward, but will retard any
movement backward.
</p>

<p>
The other consists of a hinged portion
that will enter the snow on a
back thrust. As the ski end is thin,
a block of wood must be attached to it
on the upper side, and the projecting
piece hinged to the block. The bevel
at the end allows it to dig into the
snow when the ski starts back. In going
forward, it will swing out of the
way freely.

<h2>
Crystallization Shown on a Screen
</h2>


<p>
The formation of chemical crystals
can be shown in an interesting manner
as follows: Spread a saturated solution
of salt on a glass slide, or projection-lantern
glass, and allow it to evaporate
in the lantern's light or beneath
a magnifying glass. The best substances
to use are solutions of alum or
sodium, alum being preferable. Ordinary
table salt gives brilliant crystals
which reflect the light to a marked degree.
For regular formation, where
the shape of the crystal is being
studied, use a solution of hyposulphite
of soda.
</p>

<p>
Many startling facts may be learned
from the study of crystals in this manner,
and watching them "grow" is
great sport even to the chemist.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Enlarging Photographs<br />
By A. E. Swoyer
</h2>


<p>
When the photographer wishes to
make an enlarged print from a small
negative, he arranges a suitable light
and condensers back of the negative
and by means of a lens projects the
resultant image upon a sheet of sensitive
paper. Owing to the comparative
weakness of the light, however, it is
necessary either to use bromide paper
or some of the faster brands of developing-out
paper. If a more artistic
medium is desired, a glass positive
must first be made and enlarged to
produce a negative from which the
final prints will be made by contact.
This process is somewhat clumsy and
expensive, for if any retouching or
doctoring is to be done, it must be
upon a glass surface, either that of the
two negatives or of the intermediate
positive. As all of this work is done
by transmitted light, there is the loss
of fine detail common to all enlargements.
</p>

<p>
The difficulties incident to this process
may be done away with by the
use of a modification of the popular
post-card projector; the alteration consisting
simply in the substitution of a
better lens for the cheap plate glass
with which such instruments are usually fitted.
</p>

<p>
A contact print, preferably on glossy
paper, ferrotyped, is made from the
original negative by contact in the
usual way; this is then placed in the
modified projector and the image
thrown upon a sensitive plate of the
desired size. After a brief exposure,
development will show an enlarged
negative having every quality of the
original.
</p>

<p>
The advantages of this process are
obvious. In the first place, the comparative
cheapness of the apparatus is
a factor; in the second, the intermediate
glass positive is eliminated, the
print which is substituted for it providing
a much better medium for retouching,
faking or printing in.
Transparent water colors in the less
actinic shades may be used upon this
print to control the final result, and if
spoiled, it may be replaced at a negligible
cost.

  <p>An Ordinary Post-Card Projector Used Back of a
Camera to Illuminate a Photograph Which is

</div>

<p>
At first glance, it would appear as if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>[218]</a></span>
this method were simply a form of
photographic copying; it is, in fact, the
reverse. For in copying any object
with a camera, the sensitive medium is
behind the lens and the object to be
copied is in front, and the size of the
copy is therefore limited both by that
of the camera and by its bellows draw.
In the reflection process, the object to
be copied is back of the lens and the
sensitive medium is in front; as large a
copy can be made with a small camera
as with an eight by ten. It is really
more convenient to work with a short-focus
lens and a camera of limited bellows
extension; the nearer the lens is
to the back of the camera the larger
will be the projected image.
</p>

<p>
The diagram (Fig.&nbsp;1) shows that the
size of the object to be enlarged does
not depend upon the focal length of
the lens used, as in ordinary enlarging,
but simply upon the size of the opening
in the front of the projector. The
dotted lines are drawn from the edges
of the card to be projected through the
lens. Figure 2 is a sketch of a projector
with the lens tube removed, so that
it may be used with a camera as shown

water. Fill a clean white bottle with
the solution, taking care to cork the
bottle while the liquid is hot. The
liquid remains in a fluid state as long
as the bottle is corked. When the
bottle is shown, it appears to contain
a liquid, and in handing it to a person
the performer must be careful to take
out the cork in time to allow it to
solidify. In order to gain the proper
time, pretend to be looking for a glass,
make some remark about a sudden
chill or feel the hand holding the bottle
and say it is very cold. In the meantime,
the air acting upon the solution
has caused it to become fixed and immovable,

<h2>
Homemade Enlarging Camera
</h2>


<p>
The ordinary hand camera of the focusing
type can be used to enlarge pictures
from negatives of its own make.
The requirement is a device to hold the
negative rigid in a position in front of
the camera lens, and at such a distance
that the rays of light passing through
the negative and lens will enter a box
of sufficient size for the desired enlargement
and focus plainly on a sheet
of sensitive paper attached to the end
of the box.
</p>

<p>
The first thing to do
is to find the distance
that is required from
the camera lens to the
paper enlargement to
make the proper size,
and the distance from
the lens to the negative.
A correspondent of
Camera Craft gives the
following rule for finding
these dimensions:
To find the distance between
the lens and paper
enlargement, add
1 to the number of
times the picture is to
be enlarged and multiply
the result by the
focus of the lens in
inches. The example
given is for a 6-in. focus
lens. An example: A
4 by 5-in. negative enlarged
to 8 by 10&nbsp;in. is
a two-time enlargement
(four times in area);
2+1 = 3, and 3&times;6 = 18,
the distance in inches
of the lens from the sensitive paper.
To find the distance of the lens to the
negative, divide the above result, 18&nbsp;in.,
by the number of times desired to enlarge,
18&times;2 = 9, the distance in inches
from the lens to the negative.
</p>

<p>
With these figures as a working
basis, the box can be made in any size
to use any focusing camera. The dimensions
given in the drawing are for
a 4 by 5-in. camera having a 6-in. focus
lens, and to enlarge the pictures from
a 4 by 5-in. negative to 8 by 10&nbsp;in. In
the first place make a box 8-1/2&nbsp;in. wide,
10-1/2&nbsp;in. deep and 14&nbsp;in. long, inside
measurement, using 3/4-in. material, as
shown in the sectional drawing A.
One end is left open and in the center
of the other a hole is cut 5&nbsp;in. square.

<p>
The back end of the camera is placed
over this hole as shown at B and 1/4-in.
strips nailed to the box end around
the camera back to exclude all light.
The camera must be centrally located.
</p>

<p>
The next to be made is the end board
or easel, consisting of two pieces of
3/4-in. material, one 8-1/2 by 10-1/2&nbsp;in.,
which should fit easily into the end of
the box, and a larger one, 10 by 12&nbsp;in.,
the outside dimensions of the box,
as shown at C. Nail the smaller piece
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>[220]</a></span>
to the center of the large one, crossing
the grain of wood in so doing. The
end board is the easel upon which the
sensitive paper is fastened with push
pins, and should be covered with a
sheet of white paper, pasting it on the
8-1/2 by 10-1/2-in. board with a thin coat
of glue. The slide D is a piece of wood
3/4&nbsp;in. thick, 3-1/2&nbsp;in. wide and 26&nbsp;in.
long. This is fastened to the under
side of the box with four screws, placing
it exactly in the center and parallel
with the sides of the box. Be careful
to have the slide parallel or the holder
will not freely slide upon it.
</p>

<p>
The negative holder E is made of
a piece of 3/4-in. board, 8&nbsp;in. wide and
10&nbsp;in. long. A hole 5-1/2 by 7-1/2&nbsp;in. is
cut in its center, leaving a margin of
1-1/4&nbsp;in. on all sides. This holder is
set in a groove cut in a block of wood
having a mortise cut 3/4 by 3-1/2&nbsp;in. to
fit on the slide easily. A thumb screw
is fitted in the center of the bottom of
the block of wood. This is used for
fastening the negative holder rigidly
to the slide when the focus is secured.
</p>

<p>
A 1-in. hole is bored in the upper
corner of the box end, as shown, to
serve as a peephole for seeing the
image on the end board or easel. This
is covered before putting the sensitive
paper in the box. The end board is
held in position with two flat brass
hooks. The camera is held in place with
two buttons placed on blocks of wood
the height of the camera back, as shown
at F. Two pieces of clear glass, 6 by
8&nbsp;in. in size, are held in place in the
negative holder by means of buttons,
the film negative being placed between
them. All the joints in the box must
be carefully puttied and the inside of
the box blackened, which is done with
a mixture of lampblack and alcohol,
to which is added a small quantity of
shellac to give it body.
</p>

<p>
A darkroom is not essential, a bathroom
with the window covered over
with orange paper will do, or even a
large room with the shades drawn and
pinned close to the window casing.
It is best to leave a space in one of
the windows to be covered with orange
paper, doing the developing about 10&nbsp;ft. from the source of light.
</p>

<p>
To operate the camera place it on
the enlarging box, hook the easel in
place, put a negative in the holder with
the film side toward the lens. Take the
outfit to a shady place outdoors, point
the holder end at an unobstructed portion
of the sky and look through the
peephole. Rack the lens in and out to
focus the picture. The easel should
have heavy black lines drawn upon it
inclosing parallelograms from 5 by 7&nbsp;in. to 8 by 10&nbsp;in., so that one can
readily see the size of the enlargement
to be made. When the focus is obtained
take the outfit into the darkroom, remove
the easel and fasten the sensitive
paper with push pins. Replace the
easel and take the outfit outdoors again,
point it toward the clear sky and make
the exposure, which should be at least
5 seconds with a 16 stop. It is best to
make a trial exposure on a small strip
of paper to find the proper time. Directions
for the use of bromide papers
will be found in each package.

<h2>
Multiplying Attachment for a Camera<br />
By J. C. Moore
</h2>


<p>
The hand camera suitable for this
work is the kind commonly known as
the reversible back, which is a detachable
part that carries a ground glass
for focusing and a place to insert the
plate holders. When this part is
removed, it will be seen that the back
of the camera is mortised to prevent
light from entering. Construct a
frame to take the place of the back,
but make it about 5/8&nbsp;in. larger all
around, and make one surface to fit the
mortise of the camera box.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img221c'>

  </a>
  <p>The Attachment as It is Fitted to the Camera
and the Reversible Back in the Frame</p>
</div>

<p>
A back is now made and attached to
the frame, to carry the ground-glass
reversible back, so that it can be
shifted over the center of focus for
each small portion of the plate on
which the picture is to be made.
Measure the outside of the plate holder
and, doubling the dimensions both
ways, lay out a diagram on a piece of
paper. Lay the plate holder on the
paper and move it to the extreme left,
then to the right, to see if the center
of the plate will coincide with the center
of the back. In the same manner
locate the center in a vertical position.
If the center lines do not coincide,
increase the dimensions until this
occurs. Mark, in the exact center, an
opening the size of the plate and cut
out the wood. It is best to use a three-ply
wood for making the back, but if
this cannot be obtained, procure a dry
piece of wood and mortise and glue
strips to the ends to keep the wood
from warping. Glue the frame to this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>[222]</a></span>
back, over the opening, and make
attachments to hold it to the camera
in the same manner as the reversible
back was attached.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img221b'>

    alt=''
    />
  </a>
  <p>Manner of Laying Out the Pattern for the Back and
Locating the Exact Center</p>
</div>

<p>
If pictures of two or three different
sizes are to be made, the opening in
the new back should be fitted with as
many new pieces as there are sizes of
pictures, each to have an opening of
corresponding size. For a 5 by 7-in.
plate, 1-1/8 by 1-1/4-in. pictures is a good
size, as there will be room for 24
pictures on the plate with a small margin
left for notes. The piece to fill
the opening should be made of the
same material as the back so that a
smooth joint will result. As a board
cannot be made smooth enough for a
perfectly light-tight joint, the surface
on the new back, over which the reversible
back travels, must be covered
with cloth&mdash;a piece of black velvet is
suitable&mdash;to exclude all light as the
plate holder is shifted over the back.
</p>

<p>
A frame is now made to carry the
reversible back of the camera, the size
of which will depend on the size of
the other parts, as well as on the size
of the camera to be used. This frame
consists of two horizontal strips joined
at the ends with grooved pieces, fitting
the edge of the new back, so that it
may be slid up and down in the
grooves. The crosspieces are also rabbeted
to receive the reversible back
and allow it to be moved back and
forth horizontally. The rabbet in the
horizontal strips should not be so deep
as to permit the extending edge to
overlap the ground-glass frame, thus
preventing it from moving back as the
plate holder is inserted.
</p>

<p>
If the frame on the back and the
reversible back fit tightly, they will
remain in any position, but if they are
loosely fitted, it will be necessary to
provide some means to hold them.
Small springs with pins may be fitted
to the vertically moving frame to hold
it in the position for the horizontal
rows of pictures.
</p>

<p>
The ground glass should be marked
for the size picture to be taken. The
positions of the frame and plate carrier
should also be marked so that the
plate holder need not be taken out to
find the location and focus for the next picture.
</p>

is slotted with a hacksaw to form four
projections, which are turned outward
and their ends rounded as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;2. The face of the projections

<h2>
An Acid Siphon
</h2>


<p>
When siphoning off acids or other
disagreeable or poisonous liquids, it is
very important that none of it touch
the flesh or mouth. It is almost impossible
to do this when starting the
ordinary siphon. A siphon that does
away with this inconvenience and danger
can be made as follows:
</p>

<p>
Procure a good Bunsen burner and
two pieces of 1/4&nbsp;in. glass tube, one
2&nbsp;ft. and the other 18&nbsp;in. long. Heat
the 2&nbsp;ft. length at a point 8&nbsp;in. from
one end in the flame until it can be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>[223]</a></span>
bent as shown at A. The other piece
should be plugged at one end and
then slowly and evenly heated at a
point 10&nbsp;in. from one end. When the
glass is soft, blow slowly and steadily
into the open end, at the same time
turning the tube around in the flame.
This will form a bulb, B. The ends of
the glass tube are heated and bent as
shown, at C and D, and then fused
onto the piece A, as shown at E. This
can be accomplished by heating the
piece A at a point 4&nbsp;in. from the unbent
end. When the glass becomes
soft, place one end of a short piece
of tube in it and pull out into a thread.
Break this off as close to the tube as
possible, to make a hole in the tube.
Heat the end of the tube D and also
the glass around the hole, and when
both become soft, they can be fused
together.

</div>

<p>
In use, close the end not in the
liquid and, placing the mouth at F,
exhaust the tube, thus filling it with
the liquid. When the closed end is
opened, the siphon will flow. The
liquid collects in the bulb, and if a
little care is used, none of it can reach
the mouth.&mdash;Contributed by O. F.

<h2>
Bottle-Opening Trick
</h2>


<p>
A local junk dealer, who was also
known as the "strongest man in
town," used to mystify the folks by
opening a bottle, apparently with a
stroke of his index finger. His audience
saw his index finger strike the
stopper, but did not see the knuckle of
his second finger strike the eccentric
at the point A, as shown in the sketch,
causing it to fly up while his index
finger B assisted the stopper out of the
bottle mouth.

Setting Colors in Fabrics
</h2>


<p>
The colors of fabrics or other
materials of any kind may be set by
boiling the articles in the following
solution: To 1 gal. of soft water add
1&nbsp;oz. of ox gall. This solution should
be boiling when the articles are
dropped into it. A chemical reaction
results and the colors are set or made
nonfading. The process is harmless.
Colors in wood may be treated in the
same manner.

The rocker consists of a wood box,
13&nbsp;in. long, 9&nbsp;in. wide and 1-1/2&nbsp;in. deep,
made of 3/8-in. material, together with
a similar box 1-1/2&nbsp;in. deep, that fits over
the other as a light-proof cover. Both
are given a coat of black paint.
</p>

<p>
At the center on the under side of the
tray part, a right angle made of strap
iron is fastened with screws. On the
part projecting down, a hole is drilled
to receive a sleeve made of a brass tube
which is soldered in place. An ordinary
shelf bracket is procured, one
end of which is filed and fitted with a
strip of metal having both ends turned
up slightly. Small-pointed pins are
fastened in holes drilled near the
turned-up part. The points of the pins
serve as a knife-edge for the rocker.
The extending end of the strap iron is
fitted with a pendulum rod having a
weight at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
The rocker is attached to the wall in
a convenient place in the dark room.

pieces, C, cut from the grooved edges of
flooring boards, are fastened on top as
shown. A permanent end, A, is fastened
to one end of the base. A good-size

boards. The piece D answers the
double purpose of a handle and brace.
A lock, E, is made of a bolt, having a
long thread and a square head. A hole
is bored from the under side through
the brace, and a portion of the wood
is cut out to admit the nut. A square
place is cut out to admit the square

An Old-Oak Stain
</h2>


<p>
To make old oak of ash, elm, box
alder, chestnut, maple, yew, and sycamore
wood use a solution of copper
acetate, or iron acetate. Either of these
can be made by allowing a strong acid
to come in contact with copper or
iron. Acetic acid, or vinegar, will do
for the acid. The chemical can be obtained
from a local druggist if it is not
desired to make the stain. By varying
the strength of the solution, several
shades may be obtained. A weak solution
of iron acetate gives various brown
hues. As the strength of the salt increases
by concentration, the shades of brown darken.

A Back Stop for a Workbench

<p>
In planing small pieces on a bench,
they usually have a tendency to tip up
or slide around. This difficulty can be
easily overcome by providing the bench
with an extra back stop. For this purpose
a discarded plane iron will do very
well. Its edge should be notched so
that it will easily enter the wood. The
edges of its central slot should be
beveled off, if an ordinary wood screw
is used to fasten it to the bench. A
series of holes, several inches apart
and in line with the regular back stop,
should be bored in the bench so the
screw and iron can be readily changed,
to fit varying lengths.&mdash;Contributed by

Due to the severe service they are

off at the
ends, which

for  further
use in accurate
driving.
To prevent
this, metal
bands may
be placed

sheet iron, or tin, can be used for this
purpose. One end is bent up at right
angles, the opposite end is provided
with a loop to fit over the upright portion
of the first end, and then the loop
is closed up and hammered down to
draw the metal tightly around the mallet.
The ring is secured in place with
several tacks, or short nails, driven

is new and easy to apply. A
long strip of paper, which should be
transparent, is tied into a knot. When
the ends A and B are drawn tightly,
the paper strip takes the position
shown in C. The end A is folded forward,
or in front of the knot; then the
whole is turned over and it will take

neatly and without fixtures in the following
manner: The pole is cut 1/8&nbsp;in.
shorter than the space between the
casings, and a 5/16&nbsp;in. hole is drilled
in each end, one to a depth of 1-1/2&nbsp;in.
and the other 3/8&nbsp;in. deep, a coil spring
being placed in the deepest hole.
</p>

<p>
Screws are turned into the center of
the location for the pole in the door

Trick with Knives and Glasses
</h2>


<p>
An interesting trick may be performed
with three tumblers and three
table knives. Place the tumblers in
an equilateral triangle on a table so the
knife ends, when the knives are laid
between them, as shown in the plan
sketch, are about 1&nbsp;in. away from the
tumblers. The trick is to arrange the
knives so that they are supported by
the tops of the three tumblers and
nothing else. Most observers will say
that it is impossible; some will try it
and in most cases fail. It can be done,
and the illustration shows how simply
it may be accomplished.&mdash;Contributed

horizontal piece is 24&nbsp;in. long and the
piece to which the wings are fastened
is 8&nbsp;in. long. This piece is cut so it
will have a slight slant. The brace is
a mitered piece, 13&nbsp;in. long. The frame
is fastened together with small brads,
giving it the appearance shown in Fig.&nbsp;1.

They should be 1/4&nbsp;in. thick, about 1-1/4&nbsp;in. in diameter, and have a groove cut
3/16&nbsp;in. into their faces. The pattern for
cutting the bearings is shown in Fig.&nbsp;4.
These are bent at the places shown
by the dotted lines and attached to the
main frame stick as shown by BB in

attach a wire loop to the middle of the
string, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;3. The wire
shown at L in Fig.&nbsp;3 is bent and attached
to the main frame so it will
slide easily. The trip for dropping the
wings, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2, is a small
block of wood about 2&nbsp;in. square and
1/4&nbsp;in. thick with a 1/2-in. hole in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>[229]</a></span>
center. Slip the kite line through the
hole before tying it to the kite. Place
the trip about 100&nbsp;ft. from the kite
and wedge it to the string with a small
piece of wood. The eyelets SS are necessary,
as they make it impossible for
the pulley to run off the string.
</p>

<p>
The traveler is first put on the kite
string with the end having the loop L
(Fig.&nbsp;3) up, then, after letting out 100&nbsp;ft. of string, the trip block is fastened
in place and the kite tied to the end
of the string. Hook the wire loop on
the string attached to the ends of the
wings in place in the wire catch of L,
and it is ready for the flight. When
the traveler reaches the trip, the loop
L is pushed back, thus causing the end
of the wire to slip out of wire loop and
the wings to fall back as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2,
when the traveler descends ready
to be set for another flight.&mdash;Contributed

How to Make a Small Electric Furnace
</h2>


<p>
The furnace consists of a large
flower pot containing an ordinary clay
crucible about 6&nbsp;in. in height, the space
between the two being packed with
fireclay. Two 3/4-in. holes are bored
through the sides of the crucible about
half way between the top and the bottom.
Holes corresponding to these
holes are molded in the fireclay, which
should extend several inches above the
top of the flower pot. A smaller crucible
is placed inside of the large one
for use in melting such metals as copper,
brass and aluminum. With metals
that will melt at a low degree of heat,
such as tin, lead or zinc, the large
crucible can be used alone. Each crucible
should be provided with a cover
to confine the heat and keep out the
air. The electrodes are ordinary arc-light carbons.

A 1/4-in. hole is bored in one end of
each piece, 1/2&nbsp;in. from the end. A
series of 3/8-in. holes, 1&nbsp;in. apart, are
bored along the center in each piece.
The two short pieces, E and F, have
two 1/4-in. holes bored in their centers,
1/2&nbsp;in. from each end. These
pieces are bolted to the four arms with
1/4-in. bolts as shown in the sketch. A

<p>
The four corner blocks G, H, I and
J, Fig.&nbsp;1, have a 3/8-in. hole bored in the
center of each and a dowel glued into
it with the end projecting 1-1/4&nbsp;in. on
the under side and level with the surface
on the upper side. Each of the
corner blocks is fitted with two pieces
like X, Fig.&nbsp;2. Each of these pieces
has one end round or a semicircle, and
in its center a 1/4-in. hole is bored. The
other end has a 3/8-in. hole bored 1/2&nbsp;in.
from the end.

<p>
After making the small pieces, take
the four corner blocks G, H, I and J
and draw a line on the upper side in the
center, with the grain of the wood, and
mark the angles as follows, so that
one-half the angle will be on each side
of the center line: On one end of the
pieces G and H mark a 90-deg. angle,
on the other end a 45-deg. angle, on
the piece I mark a 90-deg. and 30-deg.
angle and on J mark a 90-deg. and 60-deg.
angle. Mark the number of degrees
of each between the sides of the
angle. Place two of the pieces marked
X, Fig.&nbsp;2, on each of the corner blocks,
one piece on each side between the
different angle lines, so their round
ends will be toward the center and
toward each other with a space of 1/4&nbsp;in. between them. Clamp the pieces to
the corner blocks and bore the 1/4-in.
holes through them to secure perfect
alinement. Put the bolts in and turn
the pieces first to one angle and then
the other, and while in the respective
positions, bore the 3/8-in. holes 3/8&nbsp;in.
deep in the corner blocks. Glue a
dowel in each 3/8-in. hole of the small
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>[231]</a></span>
pieces, allowing it to project 1/4&nbsp;in.
on the under side so it will fit in the
3/8-in. hole in the corner block. Be
sure to countersink the holes for the
heads of the bolts. All bolts should be
fitted with wing nuts. All that is
necessary to change from one angle to
another is to loosen the nuts and swing
the small pieces around so the dowel
pins will drop into the other holes,
then tighten the nuts.
</p>

<p>
The triangle clamp is made in the
same manner as the picture-frame
clamp, except that the arms L and M,
Figs. 2 and 3, are half-lapped into the
crosspiece P. The bolt O is 3/8&nbsp;in.
and the head is cut off. Drill a 1/8-in.
hole in the bolt, 1/4&nbsp;in. from the end,
and bore a 3/8-in. hole in the end of the
arm N. Insert the headless bolt O
in this hole and drive a nail through
the side of the arm N, so it will pass
through the hole drilled in the bolt.
This keys the bolt in the end of the arm N.
</p>

<p>
To clamp a picture frame, set the
corner blocks G, H, I and J to the 90-deg.
angles and adjust them on the
arms A, B, C and D to accommodate
the size frame to be made, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;1. Tighten the thumbnut on the
bolt K, and this will draw all four
corners together with the same pressure.
The corners can then be examined
to see if they fit properly. If
they do not, saw in the joints with a
backsaw until they do fit.
</p>

<p>
The triangles are clamped in the
same way. The corner blocks are set
to take the proper angles. The ends
of the bolts should be slightly burred
over so that the thumbnuts cannot be
turned off.&mdash;Contributed by Chas. A.

Copying Stand for Photographic Enlarging and Reducing
</h2>


<p>
A camera stand or table, which can
be put to many uses, is easily made
and, when made, will be of particular
service, says Work, London, for enlarging,
reducing, copying, and, with a
slight modification, for making lantern
slides by reduction.
</p>

<p>
Copying with a camera on a tripod
is always a more or less complicated
job, because of the ease with which a
picture, being focused, may be thrown
out of focus, and even out of the field
of view, the camera not being attached
to the same support as the picture.
With the stand shown in the illustration,
the picture is attached to the
same support as the camera. This
makes it possible to place the apparatus
on a table, out in the open, or in
any other suitable position, where the
light may be best for the work. When
used for enlarging with artificial light
it will also be found convenient, as it
may be placed in any position in a
darkened room.

Straight-grained soft pine or poplar
is the best material to use. The side
pieces should be narrowed at one end
or to a point about halfway of their
length. The extent of this narrowing
will depend somewhat on circumstances.
The guide pieces are then attached
with screws, the two upper
pieces so that they have their upper
edges flush with the edges of the side boards.

<p>
The bottom piece, on which the
camera is to be set, is made of the two
pieces, cut as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2, and
joined with cleats, as in Fig.&nbsp;3. The
space left after part of one side of each
board has been cut away, should be
sufficient to make a slot which, when
the boards are joined together, will admit
the screw to hold the camera in
place. A rod is run through holes
bored in the sides, just below the two
pairs of guides, and fitted with a wing
nut for clamping the sliding bottom
when a focus and the size of the picture
is found.
</p>

<p>
In copying, the camera is attached
to the bottom board and the picture is
tacked to the easel. The camera is
then focused roughly by means of the
rack and pinion, the final, fine focusing
being done by moving the sliding bottom
board. For enlarging, the lantern
is placed on the sliding bottom and the
bromide paper tacked to the easel.

For lantern-slide work, which is reducing,
it is necessary to cut an aperture
in the easel, after the manner
shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. The edges of the
opening have a rabbet to receive first
a ground glass and then the negative,
both being held in place with turn buttons.
It is not necessary to have two
easels, as this opening can be fitted
with a piece to make a level surface
when the apparatus is used for copying or enlarging.

<h2>
To Make Whitewash Stick to Surfaces Coated
</h2>


<p>
In using whitewash much difficulty
is experienced in making it stick to the
substance covered. A good way to prevent
the coating from cracking and
peeling off is to add 2&nbsp;oz. of pure
sodium chloride to every 1 gal. of
whitewash mixture. This is not expensive,
but should be secured at a
drug store because some salts of
sodium are not pure and will darken
the whitewash. The sodium chloride
should be added after the whitewash
solution is made up. When this mixture
is used in buildings it will destroy
all vermin which it touches.

The young person who likes to draw
will find the device illustrated of great
assistance for outlining a portrait or a
bit of scenery which can be filled in to
make the picture. The camera consists
of a box without a cover, about
12&nbsp;in. long, 6&nbsp;in. wide and 4&nbsp;in. deep.
An oblong hole is cut in one end, a
small hole bored in the other, and a
piece cut out of the lower edge so that
one eye can be placed close to the
hole. The oblong hole, shown by the
dotted lines, is covered with a fine perforated
cardboard, the kind used for
working in mottoes with yarn. Supports
are nailed in the corners of the
box, their length being calculated to
allow the operator
to sit or stand, as desired.

<p>
The camera is
used in the manner
illustrated.
If a portrait is to
be drawn, then
the one sitting
for it must be
quiet until the
outlines are
completed. The
operator, looking through the hole,
traces the lines on the cardboard between
the perforations. When the outlines
are drawn in this manner, the
cardboard is removed and placed on
the paper or cardboard used for the
picture. The outline is then transferred
by marking with a sharp-pointed
pencil through the perforations on the
outlines as drawn. After separating
the two pieces, the markings can be
connected with a continuous line and
an exact outline will be obtained which
can be filled in as desired. The outline

  <p>The Electromagnet
Trips a Spring Plunger
That Forces a Piston on the
Camera Air Bulb</p>
</div>

<p>
It is often quite desirable to operate
the shutter of a camera from a distance,
especially in photographing birds and
animals. The device shown in the
accompanying sketch serves the above
purpose very nicely, and its construction
and operation are exceedingly
simple. In brief, the operation is as
follows: The switch A is mounted
on the limb of a tree, in such a manner
that it is not conspicuous, and connected
in series with a magnet, B, and
a battery by means of a piece of flexible
conductor, such as lamp cord. The
magnet B is energized when the switch
is closed and attracts the iron armature
C, which is mounted on an arm, pivoted
at D. The lower end of this arm is
in the form of a latch, which supports
the rod E when it is raised to its upper
position. The rod E when it is raised
compresses the coiled spring F, which
is held between the gauge G and the
washer H mounted on the rod. A
small coil spring holds the armature
C away from the core of the magnet
B. The lower end of the rod E is in the
form of a piston operating in a wooden
cylinder J. The rubber bulb at the
end of the tube leading to the camera
shutter is located in the lower end of
the cylinder J. When the rod E is
released by the latch K, it moves downward
in the cylinder J, due to the action
of the spring F, and compresses the
bulb L, causing the shutter of the
camera to be operated. A small handle,
M, may be mounted on the rod to
be used in raising it to the upper
position. The component parts of this
device may be mounted on a small
wooden base by means of brass straps,
and the terminals of the electric circuit
connected to the binding posts N
and O, as shown. The switch A may
be dispensed with and a push button
used in its place, as the operator may
station himself several hundred feet
away. It may be necessary to use a
battery of more than one cell in such cases.

<h2>
Electroplating without a Tank
</h2>


<p>
Electroplating without a plating
tank is made possible with the following
easily homemade apparatus described
in a German scientific magazine.
It consists of a rubber ball, A,
fitted at one end with a glass tube,
B, which carries at the opposite end
a small sponge. A rod, D, passes
through the rubber ball, which is
tightly corked at both ends, into the
glass tube B and carries at that end
the anode E. A small glass tube, F,
also connects the rubber ball with the
larger tube B. The connections from
the battery to the cathode, G, the object
to be plated, and to the projecting
end of the anode-carrying rod, D, are
made as shown. The rubber ball is
filled with the electrolyte, and is
squeezed so as to force the fluid
through the small tube F, into the
larger tube, B, filling it and soaking
the sponge C. The current is then
turned on, and by moving the wet
sponge over the cathode G, the latter
will be plated. Not only is this an
interesting accessory for the amateur's
laboratory, but it can be used in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>[235]</a></span>
industry where only parts of some object
are to be plated, and where it is
desired to remedy bad spots without
putting the articles back into the bath.

A Milk-Bottle Tray
</h2>


<p>
Bottled milk is difficult to deliver
without knocking the bottles together
when carrying them or while in a
wagon. There are several kinds of
wire baskets for carrying the bottles,
but they all have the disadvantage of
allowing the bottles to strike one another.
A carrier not having this fault
can be made very cheaply as follows:
Procure a board 1&nbsp;in. thick, 8&nbsp;in. wide
and 2&nbsp;ft. long, plane and make it
smooth, and use ordinary tin fruit or
vegetable cans for the bottle holders.
Cut each can off 2-1/2&nbsp;in. from the bottom
and smooth off the jagged edges
with a file. Nail these in two rows on
the board, starting 1&nbsp;in. from each end.
Attach a segment of a barrel hoop for a
handle. The carrier can be painted as
desired.&mdash;Contributed by G. H. Clemmons,

in the sketch are for making a machine
to develop a film about 29&nbsp;in. long.
The disk, or wheel, is cut from a board,
7/8&nbsp;in. thick, and the attached crosspieces
are cut from 1/4&nbsp;in. dowels to
make them 2-1/2&nbsp;in. long. These are
placed about 1&nbsp;in. apart on the circumference
of the disk.
</p>

<p>
An axle, fastened solidly in the
wheel and adjusted in the bearings, is
kept from slipping sideways by bushings
made of a spool. A crank is attached
to one end of the axle. Hot
paraffin is applied to the inside of the
tank part, to make it liquid-tight. Two
pins or hooks are attached to one of the
crosspieces to catch into the film end.
If the wheel is the correct size, the
same pins can be used for fastening the
other end of the film.

vignetting card is required, it may be
necessary to make the portion that encircles
the lens double in length, bending
it back upon itself to secure a
firmer hold. This is a cheap and efficient
vignetter that anyone can make
in a few moments of spare time.

<h2>
An Electrically Ignited Flash Light for Making Photographs
</h2>


<p>
The results obtained in a great many
cases in trying to take pictures by flash-light
are exceedingly unsatisfactory, as
the expression on the faces of the people
in the picture usually is strained
or unnatural, due to the suspense in
waiting for the flash. The following
simple device avoids this difficulty because
the flash is set off by means of
electricity, so that the operator can
control the flash from a distant point
and thus be able to take the picture
quite unawares to his subjects.
</p>

<p>
The construction of the device is as
follows: Obtain a piece of rather
heavy sheet iron, about 6&nbsp;in. wide and
10&nbsp;in. long. Bend this piece of iron
into the form shown in the sketch, and
fasten a wooden handle to it with a
wood screw. Obtain a sheet of 1/8-in.
sheet asbestos, the same size as the
piece of sheet iron, and glue it to
the inside surface of the curved piece
of iron. It is best to fasten the
four corners down by means of some
small rivets with rather large washers
under the heads next to the asbestos.
</p>

<p>
Now mount two pieces of sheet copper,
1/2&nbsp;in. wide and 6&nbsp;in. long, parallel
with each other on the surface of the
asbestos and 1-1/2&nbsp;in. apart, so that their
ends are even with the end of the piece
of asbestos. These pieces of copper
should be insulated from the piece of
sheet iron, and there should be a small
screw in one end of each and a small
binding post mounted on the other end.

plug to one end of this cord and the
other end to the two binding posts.
Open one of the conductors in the cord
at some point and introduce a single-pole
switch, as shown in the sketch.
Close the gap between the two pieces
of copper by means of a piece of No.
32 gauge copper wire. Place the flash-light
powder in position, but do not
cover up the wire or have it in actual
contact with the powder, and close the
circuit. The operator may include
himself in the picture by having a sufficiently
long piece of lamp cord and
the switch properly arranged.

To Hold a Negative in a Printing Frame

<p>
When printing postal cards and
working fast, it always bothered me to
hold the negative in the printing frame
while removing the card. To overcome
this trouble I decided to contrive
some arrangement to hold the negative
in the frame when the back was removed.
The device I made consists
of a thin, flat spring, about 1/8&nbsp;in. wide
and as long as the width of the frame
opening. Two lugs are formed and
soldered to the ends, as shown in Fig.
1, for holding the plate, and a central
lug is soldered on to provide a means
of fastening the spring in position. A
groove, about 1/16&nbsp;in. deep, was cut in
the opposite end of the frame to receive
one end of the negative.

push the spring upward until the plate
can be slipped into the slot at the
opposite end of the frame. The pressure
of the spring, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2,
will hold the plate securely. The
frame can be handled quite roughly
and as fast as desired without any
danger of the plate falling out.&mdash;Contributed

How to Make an Electrolytic Interrupter

</div>

<p>
Obtain a glass jar or wide-mouth
bottle about one-quart size. An ordinary
round bottle will serve very
nicely by having the top cut off, thus
forming a glass
jar. Make a top
for the jar from
a piece of 1/2-in.
pine similar to
the one shown in
the illustration.
The lower portion
extends
down inside the
jar and serves to
hold the top in
place. Cut a slot
in this top, 1/8&nbsp;in.
wide and 2&nbsp;in.
long.  This slot
should be cut at right angles to a diameter
of the top and extend 1&nbsp;in. on
either side of the diameter. It should
be about 1/2&nbsp;in. from the center of the
top. Directly opposite the center of
the slot drill a 3/8-in hole, 1/2&nbsp;in. from
the center of the top. Drill a 1/4-in.
hole in the center of the top to give
ventilation to the jar. Boil the completed
top in paraffin for a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
Obtain a piece of 1/8-in. sheet lead, 2&nbsp;in. wide and about 1/2&nbsp;in. longer than
the depth of the jar. Mount a small
binding post on one end of this piece
of lead and then support it in the slot
in the wooden top by means of two
metal pins. The lower end of the
piece of lead should be at least 1/2&nbsp;in.
from the bottom of the jar. Next get
a piece of 3/8-in. glass tube and fuse a
piece of platinum wire into one end.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>[242]</a></span>
Make sure the inside end of the platinum
wire is not covered with the glass,
and that the outside end protrudes a
short distance beyond the end of the
glass tube. Now bend about 3/4&nbsp;in. of
the end of the glass tube which has
the platinum in it over at right angles
to the remainder of the tube. The tube
should then be placed in the opening
on the wooden top provided for it and
a rubber band placed around it to prevent
it dropping through the opening.
The lower end of the tube should be a
little higher than the lower end of the
sheet of lead. A small quantity of
mercury should be placed in the tube
and a bare copper wire run down inside.
The mercury affords a connection
between the piece of platinum in
the end of the tube and the copper
wire. Connect the outside end of the
copper wire under a binding post and
the interrupter is complete with the
exception of the solution.
</p>

<p>
The solution for the interrupter is
dilute sulphuric acid made by mixing
about four parts of water and one part
of acid. In preparing this mixture,
be sure to pour the acid into the water,
not the water into the acid. The jar
should be about two-thirds filled. At
least 40 volts will be required for the
satisfactory operation of the interrupter.
The distance between the
platinum point and the lead sheet may
be adjusted by simply turning the glass tube.
</p>

<p>
No condenser will be required in
operating an inductor coil with an
interrupter of this kind. The make-and-break
interrupter, if there is one
in circuit, should of course be made
inoperative by screwing up the contact
point against the spring.

<p>
The little use I had for a drill press
did not make it advisable to purchase
one, so I constructed a device for drilling
iron and brass which answered all
purposes. A broken carpenter's brace
furnished the chuck, which was fastened
to a 1/2-in. shaft having a detachable
crank. The shaft turns in a
brass tube which is fitted tightly in a
hole bored in the upright. The sliding
part or table is forced up against
the drill with a 1/2-in. machine bolt.
The bolt turns in a square nut fastened
in the opposite post. The end
of the screw bears on a plate fastened
on the under side of the table to prevent
wear. A crank could be attached
to this bolt so that it may be turned
more easily.

I then cut a piece of 1/2-in. board to fit
tightly in the end of the can and turned
the edges of the tin down to hold it
in place. A hole was bored in the center
of the wood and a 1/2-in. hose coupling
fitted in it. The water will swell
the wood enough to make an absolutely
watertight joint, but by using a

possible to sprinkle close up to walks
without wetting them. The friction
is much less than in the ordinary hose
nozzle, and consequently this nozzle
delivers more water and also materially

  <p>Details of Timing Apparatus</p>
</div>

<p>
The disk was bolted to the partition
P of the darkroom, the partition having
a hole, G, to coincide with the holes
in the disk as it revolved. Four catch
pins were fastened on the rim of the
disk to engage a catch pin on the armature
of the magnet. The gong and
commutator were removed and the
magnet placed in the position shown in
the sketch. A strip of wood was fastened
across the face of the metronome
H, about 1&nbsp;in. above the pendulum
shaft or axle. On the inside of the
center of the strip a small piece of
wood was projected, with copper wire
on one side only, to form a contact
with a piece of flexible copper on the
pendulum. Wiring was made as
shown in the sketch and a switch used
to stop the disk from revolving.
</p>

<p>
An ordinary postal-card printing
frame, D, with a hinged back was
used and placed on the shelf A, as
shown. A hinge was made from heavy
elastic bands to allow for two dozen
cards in the frame at one time. As
each card was printed it was taken out
and dropped into the developer. The
reel and metronome should be wound
up after printing two dozen cards. The
stops can be varied for any length of
time by regulating the weight on the
metronome. The disk and all woodwork
must be painted a dull black.
The circuit is completed on the return
stroke of the pendulum, causing the
magnet to attract the armature, which
releases the catch, allowing a quarter
turn of the disk.&mdash;Contributed by

<h2>
Shade Roller Attached to Upper Window Sash
</h2>


<p>
Free circulation of air cannot be obtained
through a window when the
shade is attached to the window casing,
as it partly fills the opening caused
by lowering the upper sash. If the
shade roller is attached to the top of
the upper sash, the shade can perform
its function without obstructing the
opening when the sash is lowered. It
only requires a shorter roller and a
narrower shade. The roller brackets
are attached in the usual manner, but,
in order to have the shade hang vertically,
a block, as wide as the lower
sash frame, must be fastened under each bracket.

<p>
Having occasion to do a large
amount of counter-flashing in a new
wall where the mortar was soft and the
joint too large to
use an ordinary
nail or the regular
flashing hook,
I made hooks
from No. 24
gauge galvanized
iron, having
hooks of extra
size and
strength, as shown in the sketch. The
size of the hook is 1-3/4 by 3-1/8&nbsp;in. On
each side edge, 1-1/8&nbsp;in. from one end, I
cut teeth, A A, and clipped the corners
of the opposite end at an angle. The
end at B was turned down at right
angles and the points A A bent in the
opposite direction. I placed the counter-flashing
in the usual manner, with
the projection B hanging down and the
pointed end of the hook in the joint,
and drove or pushed it in tightly. The
points A A will catch on the under side
of the brick and hold solidly.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Starting a Saw Cut
</h2>


<p>
A fine piece of woodwork is often
spoiled by the amateur craftsman
when starting a cut with a saw. As the
first stroke of the saw on the edge of
the board is made, the teeth often
break a splinter from the edge or the
saw jumps to one side of the line,
thereby making a rough and uneven
cut. This can be avoided in a very simple way.

  <p>Starting a Saw on a Knife Cut will Prevent
Roughing or Splintering the Edge</p>
</div>

<p>
After marking the line, take a sharp
knife and make a cut across the edge,
as shown, and draw the knife down
well over the corners of the board for
about 1/8&nbsp;in. Place the saw on the cut
and start it slowly. The saw blade will
follow the cut of the knife blade.

A Substitute Penholder

<p>
One evening when my wife was
using the only penholder in the house
I desired to do some writing and being
in a hurry, I hastily made a substitute
holder of a pencil. Two cuts were
made in the butt end, as shown; the
pen was then slipped in, the outside
wound with a rubber band, and my
penholder was complete.&mdash;Contributed

Protecting Binding Posts on Wet Batteries from Corrosion
</h2>


<p>
When recharging the cells of a wet
battery it is best to procure the best
grade of sal ammoniac, the kind that
is put up in boxes having a sufficient
amount for one cell. Then, before putting
the solution into the cell, melt
some paraffin used for preserving purposes
and dip the upper end of the carbons,
zinc, and the glass jar in it. This
will apply a coat of insulating wax that
will prevent any white deposit from
working up on the parts and corroding
the binding posts, or terminals.
</p>

<p>
The cells are then filled in the ordinary
manner, after which the carbons
and zincs are raised just far enough to
admit a layer of common machine oil,
about 3/8&nbsp;in. thick. The oil not only
prevents evaporation but aids greatly
to keep the uncovered parts from corrosion.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Alarm to Designate a Filled Storage Battery
</h2>


<p>
When a storage battery is recharged,
the completion of the recharging is
marked by the development of gas in
the cell. This fact is the basis of a
simple electrical device which will ring
a bell when the battery is fully charged.
A glass tube bent as shown and having
a small bulb near its upper end is
inserted in the top of the cell, a small
quantity of mercury being first introduced
in the bend below the bulb.
Wires extend down the upper tubing
to within a short distance of the mercury.
These wires are connected with
binding posts so mounted that they can
rest on top of the tube, whereupon the
bell circuit is completed as shown.
Small quantities of gas may develop
during the charging of the cell, but if
a small hole is pierced in the tube between
the mercury and the cell, this
gas will not exert pressure enough on
the mercury to push it up and connect
it with the wires, which will take place
first when the development of gas becomes
very active at the completion of
the recharging.

as long as the fencing is wide, with
screw hooks set far enough apart to
catch into the meshes of the wire, and
a crosspiece attached to the board by
pieces of rope at the ends and provided
with a pulling loop in the center.&mdash;Contributed

A Centering Gauge

<p>
The centering gauge consists of a
piece of celluloid on which several
circles are drawn having different
diameters, but all drawn from the same
center. A small hole is made at the
center to admit the point of a center
punch. Two sets of circles may be
drawn on one piece as shown, but the
lines should be spaced far enough
apart to allow the metal to be clearly
seen through the celluloid. The sheet
is placed on the end of a shaft and
adjusted so that a ring will match the
circumference of the shaft, then the
center punch is set in the center hole
and struck with a hammer. The center
punch for marking is shown in the
sketch.&mdash;Contributed by Harry Holst,

An initial marker for bags can be
made of a beet or potato. Cut off
enough of the vegetable
to provide a
flat surface of sufficient
size and then
cut out the letter as
shown in the sketch,
and use shoe blacking
as ink. In cutting,
remember that
most of the letters
must be made reversed in order to
print right. For example, in making a
B, draw it out on paper and cut it out,
then lay the face of the pattern on the
flat surface of the vegetable and cut
around it.

<h3>
A Reed Basket
</h3>

<p>
Inasmuch as there is a great demand
for reed furniture and since
good weavers are comparatively few
in number, it would be well to learn
the process of reed weaving. The
weaving operations can be
learned much better through
the construction of some
small article, such as a basket
or <ins class='correction' title='jardin&egrave;re'>jardini&egrave;re</ins> cover. The center
is the most difficult part of
the basket making, and it is
best to begin with wood bottoms,
as the whole basket can
be kept in a much better form
due to the stiffness furnished
by such a bottom. It is also
an approach to the reed furniture
which is woven on framework.
The objectionable feature
of the wood bottoms is
the unfinished appearance of
the wood edge showing
through, but this
can be overcome by
the use of the roll
shown in the illustration.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img257c'>
  <img src='images/img257c.png' alt='img257c' title='img257c' />
</div>

<p>
While the wood
bottoms have been
used for this class of work for a number
of years, the roll is new and is
very popular with those who have
seen and used it. The roll can be placed
in many ways on different-shaped baskets,
and other reed pieces,
so that it is best to master this
piece of work thoroughly before
attempting the other, or
larger, pieces that will be described
later, in other articles.

The description is for a basket
5&nbsp;in. in diameter and 3&nbsp;in.
high, as shown in the illustration.
A disk of wood, 1/4&nbsp;in.
thick and 5&nbsp;in. in diameter, is
required. Basswood makes
the best bottom, but pine, or
cedar, will do. Cut a board
about 6&nbsp;in. square, and draw
diagonal lines on it intersecting
at the center, then draw a
circle, 5&nbsp;in. in diameter,
as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1;
also another circle,
using the same center,
4-3/4&nbsp;in. in diameter. Set
compass points about
5/8&nbsp;in. apart, and step
off spaces on the inner
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>[258]</a></span>
circle to make 24 points. This will
have to be tried out more than once,
to get the spaces to come out evenly
and just have the right number of
points. Holes are bored with a 1/8-in.
bit, just inside of the inner circle, back
of the places marked by the compass
points, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2. Cut the
board on the outside circle with a
coping, or turn, saw, to make the circle,
as in Fig.&nbsp;3. Do not saw out the
circle before boring the holes, as otherwise
the disk might split out in places.

The reeds placed vertically are called
spokes, and the horizontal ones are
the weavers. For the spokes, what is
called a No. 4 reed is used. Do not wet
the spokes before putting them through
the wood. Allow the ends to project
about 5-1/2&nbsp;in. below the bottom, as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. Place the bottom,
with the spokes, in water, and soak
them thoroughly, especially the part
below the bottom. About 15 minutes
of soaking will be sufficient to make
them pliable enough to bend over at
right angles. It will not injure the
wood bottom to soak it with the reeds.
As shown at A, Figs. 4 and 5, each
spoke below the wood bottom is bent,
down and back of the two nearest
spokes, B and C, then out between the
third and fourth spokes, C and D, and
so on. The last two spokes, Y and Z,
Fig.&nbsp;6, are forced under the spokes A
and B, respectively. In this illustration
the spoke Y is shown as it is being
inserted under the spoke A. When
this operation is completed, the bottom
will have the appearance of a fireworks
pinwheel.

Continue the bending of the spokes,
in the same direction, up and across
the thickness of the wood in front of
three other spokes and behind the
fourth, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;7. This would
not cover the edge of the wood entirely,
and, for this reason, other short spokes
must be inserted in front of each of
the first ones before it is brought up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>[259]</a></span>
across the edge of the wood. These
supplementary spokes should be about
4&nbsp;in. long. The manner of inserting
these spokes before making the bend is
shown at G and T, Fig.&nbsp;6. The double
spokes must be pressed down flat, when
brought up in place, without riding one
on the other. If the ends are too long
and interfere with the next pair, they
can be cut off a little with a flat chisel,
or knife, being careful not to make
them too short, or the pieces will not
stay in place. If there is still an open
space, an extra, short spoke can be inserted
to crowd the pieces together and
fill up the space.

When the roll is completed, insert
three weavers, of No. 3 reed that has
been soaked about 15 minutes, placing
them between the spokes A and B, B
and C, and C and D, as shown in Fig.
8. Pass weaver L in front of the
spokes B and C, then back of D and
out between D and E. Weaver M is
passed in front of C and D, back of E
and out in front of E and F. These
operations are clearly shown in Fig.
9. The weaver N is placed in front of
D and E, back of F and then in front
of G and H. At this point the weaver
L is used again. The weaver farthest
behind each time is brought in front
of the two spokes nearest to it, then
behind the third and out in front of the
next two spokes. Do not try to use
weavers longer than 8&nbsp;ft., which is
about half the length of a reed. When
a weaver is used up, press it back to
the side a little, push in a new reed
about 1-1/2&nbsp;in., and continue the weaving.
This is clearly shown in Fig.&nbsp;10.
This weaving is known as the triple
weave, which cinches down well and
holds tightly. The first round should
be carefully worked, so as to get the
ends of the roll properly pressed down
flat in place. Each throw of the weaver
should be well pressed down.

</div>

<p>
The break-down-tight border is used
for the finish at the top. The first
operation in making this border is
shown in Fig.&nbsp;11. The spoke A is bent
over back of spoke B and out between
spokes B and C. The spoke B is bent
over back of the spoke C and out between
C and D, and so on, until the
spoke E is turned down. Then take
the end of the spoke A, Fig.&nbsp;12, and
lay it over B, C, D, and E, in front of
F, back of G, and out between G and
H. The end of spoke F is then brought
down, also between G and H, but back
of the end of A. The end of B takes
a similar leap, passes behind H and
out between H and J; then G is brought
down behind the end of B, in the same
manner as F was brought down back
of A. The last four or five spokes are
the most difficult to handle, as they
must be forced through the first ones
to correspond with those already in
place. It is best not to pull the ends
of A, B, C, and D down too tightly at
first, keeping in mind that the last ones
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>[260]</a></span>
must be inserted under the first ones.
The last standing spokes are represented
by the full and shaded lines.
</p>

<p>
If the roll illustrated in Figs. 11 and
12 is too difficult, a simple break-down
can be used, such as shown in Fig.&nbsp;13.
To make this finish, spoke A is turned
back of spoke B, in front of spoke C
and back of spoke D, but not out again.
Spoke B is bent back of C, in front of
D, and back of E. The others are
turned down the same way. The
manner in which the two last spokes
are turned down and inserted is shown
by the double dotted lines.

The second beginning is shown in
Fig.&nbsp;16. The finishing of this top is
shown in Figs. 17 and 18. The full,
heavy lines represent the final insertions,
and the reed must be in quite a
sharp loop to make the end enter the
right place. It is then drawn down
and forced in front of the other reed
that passes out between the same spokes.

<p>
When the basket is dry, the long
ends can be cut off close up with a
knife, being careful not to cut a weaver.
If there are hairy fibers sticking out
they can be singed off over a gas, or
other, flame that will not smut. If it
requires bleaching, brush some chloride
of lime, mixed in a little water, over
the reeds and set in the sunlight for
a short time. It is better to leave the
finish a little dark rather than use
too much bleaching, as the latter will
give an objectionable whitish appearance
that looks like a poor job of painting.
</p>

<p>
In working the reeds, do not leave
them in the water longer than necessary,
as this will turn them dark. A
bleached reed will stand the water
much longer than in the natural state.
Dampen the reed frequently while
weaving it, as the weavers pack down
much closer when wet. The dampening
process is also required to remedy
the drying out caused by whisking the
reeds through the air in weaving operations.
A great variety of baskets
can be made from this form, viz., low,
tall, tapering vase forms, bowl shapes,
etc., in plain or dark weaves.

<h2>
Wireless-Lighted Lamp Deception
</h2>


<p>
Window displays of puzzling nature
usually draw crowds. A lighted globe
lying on its side in full view, yet apparently
not connected to any source of
electricity, could easily be arranged as
a window display, deceiving the closest
observer. A mirror, or window glass,
backed with some opaque material,
should be used for the foundation of
the device. For the display lamp, it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261' href='#Page_261'>[261]</a></span>
best to use a 25 or 40-watt tungsten, as
these will lie flatter on the glass than
the larger sizes, and the deception will
not be as easily discovered. The place
where the brass cap of the lamp
touches the glass should be marked
and a small hole drilled through to the
wire connecting the tungsten filament
to the plug on the top of the lamp. At
any suitable place, a hole should be
drilled in the glass plate, no larger than
is necessary, to permit two small cotton-covered
magnet wires to pass
through. One of the wires should be
looped, passed through the hole in the
cap and hooked onto the bare wire connecting
with the plug on top of lamp.
The other wire should be fastened to
the brass cap, near the drilled hole,
after which the lamp may be placed in
position and the two wires connected
to a source of electricity. If proper
care has been taken and no crosses occur,
the lamp will light, and if the display
is placed in the proper surroundings,
it will prove very deceiving. To
protect against a fuse blow-out from
a short circuit, it is advisable to run
another lamp in series with the display
lamp, as shown.&mdash;Contributed by Clyde

Live Bait Used in Fishing
</h2>


<p>
With the simple device illustrated,
no fisherman need worry over running
short of bait or even regarding the
usual repeated baiting of the hook. A
small clear-glass bottle should be procured,
and several hooks wired to it
about the neck, or at each end, as desired
or found best after several trials.
After filling the bottle with water a
live minnow is placed in it, and the bottle
is sealed with a cork, which is
notched around the edge to permit water
to enter or leave the bottle without
losing the bait. If live grasshoppers,
or similar bait, is desired the cork can
be used unnotched to form a watertight
stopper. As illuminated bait for
night fishing, several fireflies can be put
in the bottle.&mdash;Contributed by L. Wahrer,

<h2>
A Paper Gas Pipe
</h2>


<p>
When one fits up an attic or a back
room as a workshop, it is seldom that
a gas connection is available on about
the same level as the workbench so
that a Bunsen burner and soldering
apparatus may be operated. To install
the standard gas pipe, it would be
necessary either to alter the chandelier
connection or to tear up some of the
plaster, the former plan resulting in
a rather conspicuous display of pipe
and the latter in considerable expense.
The following method permits the rolling
of a pipe, about the size of a lead
pencil, from paper that becomes so stiff
that it is almost impossible to crush
it between the thumb and fingers. This
small inconspicuous pipe may be run
directly from the side of the valve on
the chandelier to the wall, as shown
in the sketch, thence down some corner
formed by a door jamb or window
frame, which protects it and renders it
almost unnoticeable.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img262'>
  <img src='images/img262.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Tube is Run Out Horizontally from the Chandelier
to the Wall Where the Drop is Connected</p>
</div>

<p>
A good grade of tough Manila paper
should be procured and cut into strips,
about 18&nbsp;in. long and wide enough to
build up a tube at least 1/32&nbsp;in. in
diameter. This will require from 4 to
6&nbsp;in., according to the thickness of the
paper. A piece of 1/4-in. round iron or
hard wood, 20&nbsp;in. long, is procured and
carefully oiled or greased. Apply a
coat of strong fish glue to one of these
pieces of paper, omitting a strip along
one edge, about 1&nbsp;in. wide. Using the
outspread fingers of each hand, begin
with the unglued edge and roll the
paper around the wood. As it is impossible
to get the paper uniformly
tight with the fingers, select a smooth
place on the table and then roll the
newly formed tube forward by means
of a piece of board, as shown in the
illustration. On the return stroke lift
the board. In this way it is possible
to get a tight, smooth tube. Immediately
withdraw the core, twisting it
slightly in a reverse direction if it
tends to stick. Before using the core
again, make sure it is free from glue
and regrease it. When a sufficient
number of tubes have been made and
hardened, neatly trim the ends off
squarely, and then form an equal number
of short tubes, about 2&nbsp;in. long, by
winding a strip of glued paper on a
large wire nail until a diameter is
reached that will fit snugly into the
pipes already made. The joints may
then be set up with strong glue and
finally wrapped with two thicknesses
of paper on the outside. The construction
of these joints is shown in the
cross section.
</p>

<p>
The connection with the chandelier
can be made by means of a metal tube
soldered in at a point where the regular
valve will cut off all connection
with the paper piping when it is not
in use. This metal tube should be
coated with thick shellac, and the paper
tube slipped over it for 1&nbsp;in. or more,
after which the joint should be given
several additional coats on the outside.
A small regulating gas cock can be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>[263]</a></span>
attached to the lower end of the piping,
and if this is rigidly fastened to the
wall, or casing, the connecting and
disconnecting of the rubber tubing will
not disturb the piping in any way.&mdash;Contributed

In an emergency, and to substitute

plate on an ordinary washing board, I
fitted a series of 3/8-in. dowels horizontally
across the board, closely together.
This proved to be better than glass or
zinc, as fabrics adhered to the wood
dowels and caused them to revolve,
making a more desirable rubbing surface
and accomplishing the work of
loosening the dirt in the fabric with far
less effort than that necessary on the

<h2>
Trick of Taking Dollar Bill from Apple
</h2>


<p>
A rather pleasing, yet puzzling, deception
is to pass a dollar bill into the
interior of an examined lemon or apple.
This can be accomplished in several
ways, either mechanically or purely
by sleight of hand. The mechanical
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>[264]</a></span>
method, of course, is the easier and
really just as effective. In performing,
a plate with three apples is first exhibited,
and the audience is given choice
of any one for use in the experiment.
The selected one is tossed out for examination
and then returned to the performer,
who places it in full view of the
spectators while he makes the dollar
bill vanish. Taking the knife he cuts
the apple into two pieces, requesting
the audience to select one of them.
Squeezing this piece he extracts the dollar
bill therefrom. The entire secret is
in the unsuspected article&mdash;the table knife.
</p>

  <img src='images/img264a.png'

  />
  <p>The Dollar Bill is Hidden in
the Knife Handle That Cuts the Apple</p>
</div>

<p>
The knife is prepared by boring out
the wooden handle to make it hollow.
Enough space must be made to hold a
dollar bill. The knife lies on the plate
with the fruit, the open end facing the
performer. After the bill has been
made to vanish and the examined apple
returned to the entertainer, he takes
it and cuts it in half. One of the halves
is chosen, the performer impaling it on
the end of the knife blade and holding
it out to view. While still holding the
knife he turns the blade downward and
grasps the half apple and crushes it
with a slight pass toward the knife-handle
end where the bill is grasped
along with the apple, which makes a
perfect illusion of taking the bill out of
the apple.
</p>

<p>
As to the disappearance of the dollar
bill, there are many ways in which this
may be accomplished. Perhaps the
method requiring the least practice is
to place the bill in the trousers pocket,
and then show the audience that the
latter is empty. This can be done by
rolling the bill to small compass, and
pushing it into the extreme upper corner
of the pocket where it will remain
undetected while the pocket is pulled
out for inspection. Other combinations
can be arranged with the use of the
knife, which is simple to make and very inexpensive.

It is almost impossible to make a

Procure two pieces of tin, or sheet
brass, cut them as shown, and drill

the buttonhole slot, then punch a hole
at the end with an ordinary belt punch.
Such a punch can be purchased from
a local hardware dealer in any size. In

Removing Basketball from Closed-Bottom Receptacle
</h2>


<p>
The closed-bottom basket used in the
game of basketball is so high that it
is difficult to remove the ball after a
goal is made. Generally a long stick
is used for this purpose, but I desired
to have a better way, and the device
shown in the illustration was the outcome.
A light iron rod was hinged
to the edge of the basket and bent to
its inner shape, the lower end resting
at about the center of the basket. A
rope was attached to the lower end
and run up and over a sheave pulley
attached to the basket support, then
down so it could be easily grasped.
When a goal is made, it is only necessary
to give a pull on the rope for
throwing the ball out of the basket.&mdash;Contributed

Testing Dry Batteries
</h2>


<p>
For testing dry batteries or any low-voltage
current, take an ordinary thermometer
and wind around the mercury
bulb enough wire to make about 10
ohms resistance. This will make a
good tester. A dry cell of about 2 volts
attached to the ends of the wire should
generate enough heat to expand the
mercury about four degrees in one-half minute.
</p>

<p>
This tester is not as fast as a voltmeter,
nor has it as wide a range, but
it is reasonably accurate, and by using
a battery of known voltage, the winding
can be increased or diminished to
allow the mercury to expand as many
degrees as desired per volt.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
A Trunk Mystery
</h2>


<p>
Doubtless every person has seen the
trunk mystery, the effect of which is as
follows: A trunk, mounted upon four
legs, is brought out on the stage and
proven to be empty by turning it all
the way around to show that there is
nothing on the back, whereupon pieces
of plate glass are placed along the back,
sides, and front, the trunk is closed and
given a swift turn and then opened,
when to the amazement of all, a lady
steps out appearing to come from nowhere.
The secret of this trick is very
simple, and the trunk can be made up
very cheaply.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img267b'>
  <img src='images/img267b.png'

  <p>A Shelf and Panel Set at Right Angles to
Form a Place at the Back for the Assistant
to Conceal Herself, No Matter Which Way
the Trunk is Turned to Face the Audience</p>
</div>

<p>
In the back of the trunk there is a
movable panel with a shelf exactly the
same size as the panel attached to its
bottom, forming a right angle, the corner
of which is hinged to the bottom
of the trunk. The back panel can be
turned in until it rests on the bottom
of the trunk and, when this is done,
the shelf part rises and takes its place,
making the back of the trunk appear solid.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img267c'>
  <img src='images/img267c.png' alt='img267c' title='img267c' />
</div>

<p>
When the trunk
is brought out
upon the stage, the assistant
is crouching on
the shelf. The trunk can
then be shown empty.
This is all very simple
until the trunk is turned
around when it takes
skill not to give the trick
away. As soon as the
performer starts to turn the trunk
around, the assistant shifts her weight
on the panel, thus causing it to fall inward
and bring the shelf up to make
the back appear solid. The assistant is
now in the trunk, and the back can be
shown clear of any apparatus. When
the trunk is turned to the front again,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>[268]</a></span>
the lady repeats the previous operation
in the opposite direction, thus
bringing her body to the back of the
trunk again.
</p>

<p>
To make the trick appear more difficult,
glass plates are made to insert in
the ends, front and back of the trunk.
In making the trunk, have the back the
same size as the bottom. Fit the piece
of glass for the back into a light frame,
similar to a window frame. This frame
is hinged to the bottom of the trunk
and is 1/2&nbsp;in. smaller all around than
the back of the trunk, so that the two
pieces of glass can be put in the ends
and also allow the back frame and glass
to fall flush in the bottom of the trunk.
A few rubber bumpers are fastened in
the bottom of the trunk to catch the
glass without noise as it falls. The
best way to work this is for the performer
to let the frame down with his
right hand while he is closing up the
front with his left.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the trunk is closed, the
assistant again shifts her weight to
cause the panel to fall in and then the
trunk can be turned to show the back,
or whirled around and turned to the
front again, then opened up, whereupon
the assistant steps out, bows to the
audience, and leaves the stage.

How to Make a Candy-Floss Machine

cut a hole about one-half the diameter
of the pan in the bottom and solder
in a conical-shaped piece similar to a
cake pan, allowing it to extend up inside
about half the height of the pan.
Fasten supports to the pan so that a
Bunsen burner can be set under it
where the flame will pass through the
conical center opening.
</p>

<p>
Mount a small battery motor with
its shaft vertical, pulley end up, and
centering the conical hole, on a base,
which supports the pan. Procure a can
cover, similar to that used on coffee
cans, and fasten it with solder to the
pulley on the motor shaft, being careful
to locate it centrally so that it will
run smoothly.

<p>
Close to the bottom and in the rim
of the can cover, make a number of
small holes with a prickpunch, or other
sharp-pointed tool. Wire the motor to
the battery, and the candy-floss machine
is ready for use.

Enlarging Pictures
</h2>


<p>
A very simple and sufficiently accurate
way of enlarging pictures by
means of a pencil holder and elastic is
shown in the illustration. The picture
to be enlarged is fastened to a table top
or drawing board, and the paper on
which it is to be drawn is placed directly
below it. A small brad or tack
is driven into the board at A, the location
depending on the desired size of
the enlarged picture, and the elastic is
attached to it. The pencil holder B is
fastened to the other end of the elastic
over the drawing paper. A pointer, or
a knot, is placed in the elastic at C.
The pencil holder consists of a stick of
wood turned into a handle with a hole
bored centrally for a pencil.

The rules for playing the game are
as follows: Three baseballs are used.
The players stand about 10&nbsp;ft. distant
and in front of the buckets. Each
player, or side, is only permitted to
throw three balls an inning, irrespective
of the number of runs scored.
Any kind of delivery is permitted, but
an underhand throw will be found
most successful. The buckets are
numbered from 1 to 4, and represent,
respectively, one, two, and three-base
hits, and home runs. The one in which
the ball stays designates the run.
</p>

<p>
Plays are figured as in a regular
ball game. For instance, if a ball
should stay in bucket No. 2 and the
next in bucket No. 3, the first man
would be forced home, counting one
run, and leaving one man on third base.
</p>

<p>
If the next ball stays in bucket No.
4, the man on third base is forced
home, as well as the one who scored
the home run, making three runs for
that inning. The runs should be
scored as made, to guard against confusion
and argument.&mdash;Contributed by

How to Nickel or Silverplate Iron by Friction
</h2>


<p>
The following methods of plating
iron with nickel and silver appeared
in a recent issue of a German paper.
In nickelplating iron, a thin coating of
copper is first produced on it by rubbing
on a solution of 20 parts sulphate
of copper, 5 parts sulphuric acid and
100 parts of water. After the copper
plate has been formed rub over it, with
a rag, a solution of 3 parts tin, 6 parts
nickel and 1 part iron in 100 parts of
hydrochloric acid and 3 parts of sulphuric
acid. If finally the object is
rubbed with a rag that has been dipped
in finely pulverized zinc, a nickel deposit
will be formed on the copper.
The thickness of the deposit of nickel
can be increased by repeating the two
last operations.
</p>

<p>
According to a recent patent, a silver
coating can be produced by dissolving
freshly precipitated chloride of silver
in a solution of hyposulphite of soda,
1.1 parts to 10 parts of water, and adding
to this solution 180 parts spirits
of sal ammoniac and then stirring in
800 parts of finely washed chalk. This
mixture is applied and rubbed until it
dries on the object being silvered, and
the result is a brilliant deposit of pure silver.

String-and-Ball Trick
</h2>


<div class='imgfr' id='img273c'>

</div>

<p>
The stopping of a ball on a string at
any desired point is understood by almost
every person, but to make one
that can be worked
only when the operator
so desires is a
mysterious trick.
Procure a wooden
ball, about 2&nbsp;in. in
diameter, and cut it
into two equal parts.
Insert a small peg
in the flat surface of
one half, a little to
one side of the center,
as shown, and
allow the end to
project about 3/16&nbsp;in.
The flat surface of
the other half is cut
out concave, as
shown, to make it
1/2&nbsp;in. deep. The two halves are then
glued together, and a hole is drilled
centrally on the division line for a
string to pass through.
</p>

<p>
To do the trick, hold an end of the
string in each hand tightly and draw
it taut with the ball at the top, then
slacken the string enough to allow the
ball to slide down the string. To stop
the ball at any point, pull the string taut.
</p>

<p>
Before handing the ball and string
out for inspection, push the string from
each side of the ball and turn it slightly
to throw it off the peg. This will
allow the string to pass freely through

  <p>The Expansion and Contraction of the Ropes Keep

<p>
The shaft A is supported on the
edges, in the bearings B and C, of a
tank, D. A disk, E, having a central
hole larger in diameter than the shaft,
is located at the middle of the latter.
The disk is supported by 12 or more
cotton ropes, F. The tank is filled
to the level G with water. The lower
ropes, being immersed in the water,
shrink and lift the disk slightly above
the center in the position of an eccentric,
as shown by the dotted lines in
the sketch. The center of gravity of
the disk in this position, being higher
and slightly to one side of the shaft,
the disk has a tendency to turn around.
The motion drives the next rope into
the water where it becomes soaked
and shrinkage takes place again, lifting
the disk to a higher position, while
the rope coming out of the water dries
out. The ropes emerging from the
water but not yet thoroughly dry
cause the upper part of the disk to be
in an eccentric position laterally with
reference to the center of the shaft,
thus causing the center of gravity to
be not only above but also slightly to
one side.&mdash;Contributed by Charles

<p>
Many times it is quite an advantage
to have a lamp or group of lamps so
connected that the current may be
turned on or off by any one of a
number of different switches. For example,
the lights in a long hall or
passage-way can be lighted or extinguished
by operating a switch at
either end of the hall; the lights in the
upper and lower halls of a residence,
turned on or off by operating a switch
upstairs or downstairs as the case
might demand; the lights in the
garage, controlled by switches at both
the inside and outside door, etc.

switches, as illustrated in this drawing,
are in such a position that the lamps

the circuit will be open. The
dotted lines at switch C show the connections
through switch C after it has

then will again close the circuit, by
using the dotted lines in switches C

The dimensions are a matter of
choice, but one 4&nbsp;ft. long, 2&nbsp;ft. wide
and 18&nbsp;in. deep is a good size. The
back of the box is provided with two
cleats, each 2-1/2&nbsp;ft. long, fastened at

As portions of the letters and numerals,
such as the center in an O, would
fall out if cut entirely around, some

can be cut on a jigsaw, the opening
for the clock face being cut slightly
smaller than the metal of the clock so
that only the face shows. An opening
in the back piece should be cut a little
smaller than the one in front, to provide
a free opening for winding the

small round-head brass brads or
screws and finish to match the furniture.

<h2>
Mixing Sulphuric Acid
</h2>


<p>
One of the first lessons given a
student in chemistry is how to mix
sulphuric acid with water. This would
naturally be supposed to be very easy,
yet, if it is not done right, it will surely
result in injury to the person doing
the mixing.
</p>

<p>
The specific gravity of sulphuric
acid is 1.849 and, on account of its
chemical attraction to water, great
heat is set up or generated when the
two are being mixed. If the acid is put
into a jar and the water poured onto
it, they will be temporarily separated,
as the heavy acid will remain at the
bottom, the chemical reaction taking
place on the dividing line only. This
soon generates heat which rapidly increases
until steam is formed. Then
the water boils over and finally becomes
a bubbling volcano which readily
ejects the contents of the jar. As
the mixture at this moment is very
hot, bad burns will be the result,
which are aggravated by the biting of
the acid; and clothing or anything
that it comes in contact with will be
ruined or badly damaged. Always remember
this caution: add the acid to
the water.
</p>

<p>
The following is the proper way to
proceed in mixing sulphuric acid as
well as other acids of lighter weight.
Place the water in a jar and pour the
acid in, a little at a time, stirring the
mixture with a wooden stick. The
mixing process will always heat the
solution, which in many instances,
must be allowed to cool before using.

In the shop or factory oil torches

An Electric-Light Bulb as Barometer

<p>
To use a discarded electric bulb as
a fairly reliable barometer the point is
broken off with a pair of pliers while
holding the bulb under water. As the
bulb is a vacuum, it completely fills
with water. If the bulb is now suspended
from a wire or thread fastened
at the socket end, the water will not
run out of it in fair weather when the
atmospheric pressure is normal or high,
but if the pressure falls, as happens
when bad weather is approaching, the
water will begin to bulge out of the
small opening and sometimes a small
drop may even fall off. When, with returning
fair weather, the atmospheric
pressure increases, the water can no
longer bulge or drop out of the bulb.

A Swinging-Pendulum Trick
</h2>


<p>
To swing a pendulum, picked out
from a number of them at random,
without touching it is a very puzzling
trick. The articles necessary are a medium-sized
table and a number of pendulums,
some of which are suspended
from a rod with their lower weighted
ends inside of water and wine glasses
placed on the table, and others attached
to corks so that they will hang
inside of bottles.
</p>

<p>
The spectators gather around the
table which can be in full light. The
performer sits at one side of the table
with his hands flat on the top. A person
may pick out any pendulum and
ask him to swing it, which he will proceed
to do without touching it, also
making it strike the glass while it
swings. Another pendulum may be
pointed out and he will start that one
apparently by looking at it, while the
other one stops.

  <p>Any One Pendulum can

</div>

<p>
This may seem to be impossible, yet
it is very easy. It will be seen that
no two pendulums have the same
length. A pendulum makes a certain
number of swings in a given time, depending
on its length. A long pendulum
requires more time to complete
its swing and will, therefore, make a
less number of swings than a short one
in the same time. It is only necessary
to move the table slightly and watch
the pendulum picked out until it begins
to swing independently of the
others, which soon happens. To make
the longer pendulums swing, longer
movements of the table top must be
made. With a little practice anyone
can become a skilled medium in pendulum
swinging.&mdash;Contributed by James

<h2>
Tricks Performed with Thumbs Tied Together
</h2>


<p>
To have one's thumbs securely tied
together by any person in an audience
and examined by the spectators, then
have some one throw a hoop or bicycle
rim on one of the performer's arms as
if the thumbs were not tied, seems impossible,
yet this trick can be done,
and its simplicity is its own protection,
even though performed close to a committee
selected from the audience. A
stick can be held perpendicularly by
anyone with one hand at each end and
the performer can thrust his arms at
the stick which passes between them
with the thumbs apparently tied
tightly together. The same effect is
produced on the arm of any person,
while the hands are tightly clasped,
and before and after each movement
the tied thumbs are examined by the committee.
</p>

<p>
The two cords used for the trick
are made as follows: The first should
be about 17&nbsp;in. long, 1/4&nbsp;in. in diameter
at its center and tapering to points at
the ends. The other cord is about 13&nbsp;in. long, 1/8&nbsp;in. in diameter in the center
and also tapering at the ends. They
are constructed of Chinese or Japanese
paper, which is a soft, but very tough,
fibrous texture. Cut the paper into
strips, 1&nbsp;in. wide, taking care that the
grain, or rather the fiber, runs lengthwise.
Beginning at one end, twist the
paper on itself at an angle as in rolling
the old-fashioned paper lamp lighter.
Each turn should lap over the former
about half of its width. When within
3&nbsp;in. of the end of the first strip apply
another by moistening the joining ends
and continue the twisting. When the
length given is reached, break off the
strip and start back over the first in
the opposite direction. Lay on enough
layers to secure the diameter given.
When finished, the cords should be
strong enough to resist the pressure
applied by the hands.

  <p>Manner of Crossing the Thumbs to Receive the
Double Tie of the Cord</p>
</div>

<p>
With all fingers pressed together
spread both thumbs away from the
hands, as shown at A. Lay the right
thumb across the left, as at B, the large
knuckle bone of one lying directly over
that of the other. The largest cord is
laid over the crossing and both ends
brought down, crossed under the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282' href='#Page_282'>[282]</a></span>
thumbs, then up again, and tied in two
knots on top of the right thumb, as at
C. The trick in the tying is at this
point. Just as the tie is being made
pull the left thumb until the smallest-diameter
joints reach the cord and pull
down with the left hand. Push the
right thumb so that the fleshy part enters
as far as possible into the cords.
Insist on the tie being made tightly.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img281b'>
  <img src='images/img281b.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Cords as They are Placed around the Thumbs
and Tied in a Double Knot</p>
</div>

<p>
The second and smaller cord is laid
below the right thumb as shown at D,
and on top of the left against the first
cord, crossed, brought back and tied
twice. When this is being done reverse
the pushing and pulling as described,
pushing the left thumb and
pulling out on the right. Secure all
the slack on the left thumb, the right
being pushed into the cords at its
smallest diameter and the second cord
being tied high up and as near the
right thumb as possible, with knots
tightly drawn. If this second knot is
not tight it will give trouble in performing
the trick.
</p>

<p>
The release is made by bringing the
tips of the fingers together and placing
the thumbs into the palms. If the
ties have been carefully made there will
be no trouble to withdraw the left
thumb as it is masked by the hands.
The peculiar nature of the paper cord
causes the loop from which the thumb
was removed to remain open and rigid
as a wire loop, and if the last tie was
tightly drawn, the second cord will not
slip down to close the loop. In approaching
the hoop, stick, or arm,
touch the thing to be passed with the
finger tips and withdraw them, swaying
backward a few times and, in the
last swing before making the pass, remove
the thumb from the loop. After
passing, replace the thumb in the loop.
In passing the object, open the finger
tips, then close them and open the
palms, and push the left thumb back
into the loop, close the palms and apply
a strain on both thumbs, then show
the tie. Be careful to press both
thumbs closely into the palms in passing
so that they will not strike the object.
</p>

<p>
Always exhibit the tie from the back
of the hands with the palms spread out.
If there is any difficulty in drawing
out or replacing the thumb in the loop,
it is because the ties have not been
properly made or tied when the thumbs
were in the right place. It requires
some practice to do the trick quickly.&mdash;Fayette.

<h2>
A Way to Keep Home Accounts
</h2>


<p>
An easy way to keep track of all the
home expenses is by the popular card
system. The index cards can be had
at any stationery-supply house. Place
the cards in a box on end and have a
good supply of blanks back of them
ready for use. Under, or back of, each
letter place as many blanks as is necessary,
and almost instantly any item of
expense in the home may be found,
such as the cost of coal for the year,
drugs, meat, the cost of clothing for
a child, and the account of the head of
the family. The boy's account might
read as follows under the letter J:
</p>

<p class='center'>
Johnnie
</p>

<table summary='Example account'>
  <tr>
    <td class="r" style="width:6%;">Jan.</td>
    <td class="r" style="width:2%;">3</td>
    <td style="width:16%;">Shoes</td>

<p style='text-indent:0;'>
and so on through the year. The mother
can see at a glance just when the last
shoes were bought, and how much it
cost for books and paper.
</p>

<p>
Everything pertaining to the home
keeping can be so recorded and each
year compared. Once given a trial no
other bookkeeping will be required in
the home where time counts. Children
can be taught to keep account of their
expenses in this way, and thus thrift
and good business methods are encouraged.&mdash;Contributed

How to Make a Blowgun
</h2>


<p>
Either a 12-in. length of a small curtain-rod
tubing or a straight piece of
small bamboo pole, cut off between the
joints, can be used for the gun part
of this simple device. If bamboo is
used, see that it is cleaned out smoothly
on the inside.
</p>

<p>
The dart used in the gun is shown
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283' href='#Page_283'>[283]</a></span>
at A in the illustration. It is made by
threading the eye of a darning needle
full of yarn, clipping all the strands
off to a uniform length of about 3/4&nbsp;in.,
and then picking out the fibers into
a brushlike mass above the needle's
eye. Another needle or pin can be
used for fuzzing the threads. The
point to observe is that the brush is of
somewhat larger diameter than the
bore of the gun, so that when the
needle is pushed into the mouth end
the brush will be compressed and make
an air-tight plug.

blast of the breath into the gun. The
dart will travel with great speed and
accuracy for 20&nbsp;ft. or more, and stick
wherever it strikes. The point being

<p>
A good brush for applying acid to
articles for soldering can be made of
a piece of small copper pipe for the
handle, and fine copper wire for the
brush. To make the brush part, take
a piece of cardboard, about 1-1/4&nbsp;in.
wide, and wind several turns of No.
28 gauge copper wire around it, then
remove the coil, insert about 1/2&nbsp;in. of
it in the pipe, and flatten the latter to
hold the wire. Clip the ends of the
wire, and a brush will be had that ordinary
acids will not affect. If only
a short piece of pipe is available, it can
be used as a ferrule and a handle made
of wire or wood.&mdash;Contributed by A.

Rubber-Band-Change Trick

<p>
The trick of changing a rubber band
from the first and second fingers to the
third and fourth, if done quickly, can
be performed without detection by any
one. The band on the first two fingers
is shown to the spectator as in Fig.&nbsp;1,
with the back of the hand up. The
hand is then turned over and the band
drawn out quickly, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2,
in a manner as to give the impression
that the band is whole and on the two
fingers. While doing this, quickly fold
all the fingers so that their ends enter
the band, and turn the hand over and
let go the band, then show the back
with the fingers doubled up. In reality
the fingers will be in the band, as in
Fig.&nbsp;3, and the back will still show the
band on the first two fingers. Quickly
straighten out all the fingers, and the
band will snap over the last two fingers,

A Swinging Electric-Light Bracket
</h2>


<p>
The light bracket shown is both ornamental
and useful and can be swung
from one side of the room to the other
in an instant, a feature that is of great
value in a dimly lighted kitchen. It can
be made of either brass or soft iron,
but, for the sake of convenience, the
description will be for one made of brass.
</p>

<p>
Procure four pieces of brass, 1&nbsp;in
wide, 1/8&nbsp;in. thick and 7&nbsp;in. long, and
bend them to the shape shown at A.
These are to form the ceiling bracket.
A 3/16-in. hole is drilled in the end of
each piece to be against the ceiling.
The other end is bent slightly concave
and soldered to a brass collar, B, which
is threaded on the inside. This collar
must be of such a size that it will screw
on the end of a brass pipe, C, 1&nbsp;in. in
outside diameter. The length of this
pipe should be 18 or 20&nbsp;inches.
</p>

<p>
The base D of the bracket is made of
a brass bar, 1/8&nbsp;in. thick, 1/2&nbsp;in. wide and
45&nbsp;in. long, a scroll being turned on 6&nbsp;in. of its length at the globe end, and 3&nbsp;in. of the other end turned up at right
angles and soldered to a ring made of
1/16-in. brass that acts as a bearing
around the pipe.

A Ring-Throwing Game

<p>
The board for this game is made of
a cover from an old candy or lard pail,
washed and painted black. When the
paint is dry, place 50 pegs on the surface
as shown and number them with
white paint or by fastening numbers
cut from paper below them. The
numbering of the pegs is not consecutive,
but low and high numbers distributed
with the object in view of
making it difficult to secure a high score.
</p>

<p>
Each player has a set of five rings,
which are nothing else but rubber
fruit-jar rings. These can be purchased
at a grocery store. The board is hung
on a wall or post, and the player stands
about 5 or 6&nbsp;ft. away and throws the
rings, one at a time, trying to ring pegs
having the highest numbers. The sum
of the numbers corresponding to the
pegs ringed counts toward the final

<p>
A double clothesline of any length
should have a supporter in the center
to keep the line from sagging when
the clothes are
hung on the lower
one. The supporter
shown in
the sketch saves
the wear from the
strain on the lines.
It also keeps the
clothes in a higher
current of air so
that they dry quicker.
</p>

<p>
The supporter is made of two nickelplated
rings measuring 2&nbsp;in. in diameter.
They are bound together as
shown. The rings being nickelplated,
the supporter will not rust the clothes.
The clothes should be arranged on
the lower line so that the supporter
will rest in the center.&mdash;Contributed

can be easily made as follows: Two
wires are run from a plug, A, one to
a socket, B, and the other to terminate
at C. The line from the other side of
the socket B terminates at D.
</p>

<p>
In testing a fixture, the plug A is
turned into a socket of some source
of current, and a lamp is turned into
the socket B. The terminal C is held
to the metal covering of the fixture,
while the end D is held to one of the
wires. If there is a leak of current,
the lamp at B and those of the fixture
will light up.&mdash;Contributed by Fred

<h2>
How to Demagnetize a Watch
</h2>


<p>
Quite often the attendants or a visitor
to an electric-light plant discovers
after a few days that his watch is losing
a half hour or more a day by having
become magnetized by the dynamos.
In stations where the old types
of machines are still in use there is a
great deal more danger from what is
called "stray" magnetic fields than in
those where modern machines are installed.
</p>

<p>
The jeweler demagnetizes a watch
in the following way: He has a piece of
soft iron with an opening cut in its
center of such shape and size as to receive
the watch, and with a fine wire
wound about it. After the watch has
been placed in position, an alternating
current, that is, one whose direction is
changing at regular intervals, is sent
through the winding, and thus a magnetic
field is produced that also
changes in direction as the current reverses.
The current is gradually reduced
in value and the magnetism originally
possessed by the watch is removed.
When an alternating current
is not available, a direct current may
be used, its direction being rapidly reversed
by what is known as a "polarity changer."
</p>

<p>
Anyone can demagnetize his own
watch, however, with very little
trouble and no expense by a much simpler
method. Procure a piece of heavy
linen thread about 3&nbsp;ft. long, attach
one end of it to the ring of the watch,
hold the other end and turn the watch
around until the thread is twisted at
least one hundred times. Now allow
the thread to unwind, and as the watch
revolves, pass it back and forth near
a powerful electromagnet. The field
magnet of a good-sized generator or
motor will answer. The machine
should be in operation, or at least there
should be a current in the windings
about the fields, when you attempt to
demagnetize the watch. While the
thread is unwinding, and the watch
moved in the magnetic field, gradually
withdraw from the magnet so that
when the watch ceases to revolve, it is
just outside of the field.
</p>

<p>
Always be sure to keep the watch
revolving while it is in the magnetic
field, otherwise the results will be very
unsatisfactory, and more harm than
good may result.
</p>




<h2>
A Pencil Holder

Procure a piece of paper, 7&nbsp;in. long
and 4&nbsp;in. wide, and roll it one time
around a lead pencil, then coat the

glue. Roll this around the pencil and
a tube is formed, which will hold a
pencil or even pieces of pencil down
to 1/2&nbsp;in. in length.&mdash;Contributed by

the chopper at little cost. For the
cutting blades use two pieces of steel
a little heavier than oil-barrel hoops,
each 1-1/2&nbsp;in. wide and 8&nbsp;in. long. Procure
a 1/2-in. iron rod, about 3&nbsp;ft. long,
bend one end in the shape of a spade
handle and split the other end for a
distance of about 2-1/2&nbsp;in.

touching in the center and insert them

riveted or welded in place. Heat and
bend the blades at right angles.
</p>

<p>
Many of the materials mentioned
for poultry foods may be chopped in

<h2>
Wood Postal Cards
</h2>


<p>
The card consists of three pieces,
or three-ply, veneer. The grain of the
outside veneer runs lengthwise, while
that of the inside piece runs crosswise.
This makes the card straight and keeps
it from breaking. For the inner section,
walnut, which may be had as thin
as 1/64&nbsp;in., or any thin straight-grained
veneer may be used. Two
pieces of veneer, about 3-3/4&nbsp;in. wide
and 6&nbsp;in. long; one piece, 6&nbsp;in. wide
and 3-3/4&nbsp;in. long,&mdash;the length being
with the grain of the wood&mdash;and two
blocks of wood, known as cauls, of the
same size or a little larger, and about
7/8&nbsp;in. thick, are required.
</p>

<p>
The veneer is laid flat on a board
and cut with a sharp knife or fine saw
along the edge of a ruler. The three
pieces are glued together in the following
manner. Use ordinary hot glue,
not too thin, but thin enough to run
freely from the brush. The glue is applied
evenly on both sides of the inner
piece only, and this is then stood on
edge until the glue chills. Then the
cauls are heated. This is best done on
a stove, or on stove lids over a gas
fire. While the blocks are being
heated, put one veneer on either side
of the middle piece, and a piece of thin
paper on each side to keep the glue
from the cauls. A hand screw or vise
should be opened to almost the distance
required. One of the cauls is
now laid flat, the veneers upon it and
the other caul on top. This should be
done quickly. Then clamp the whole
firmly together. While the full pressure
is only needed for about two
hours, the pieces should be allowed to
dry between the cauls for, say, a day
or two, so that they will keep straight.
The size of the finished card is 3-3/8&nbsp;in.
by 5-1/2&nbsp;in. It is cut and planed to size
while lying flat on a board, the plane
being pushed along on its side on the
bench top. To dress or clean, clamp
one side to the bench. While a scraper
blade may be used to advantage, it is
not essential, as a block of wood and
sandpaper will do. The thinner it is
dressed the better. The sharp edges
should be removed with sandpaper.
The writing on a wood card is not
done in the ordinary manner, as the
ink would run. The surface must be
prepared, which also gives a finish to
the wood. Melt some wax or paraffin
in a suitable vessel and cover the surface
of the wood, using a brush or rag.
The lines for the address on one side
are then drawn, and the writing is
done with a hard lead pencil. When
through writing on one side, cover it
with some strong aniline stain.
(Aniline, dissolved in hot water, commonly
known as water stain and used
especially to stain mahogany, is the
right kind.) Do not remove the wax
that was raised by the pencil point.
Brush the stain over until the whole
side is covered. When dry, repeat on
the other side. In about an hour the
wax may be scraped off with a dull
scraper or some other dull instrument.
After every particle of wax has been
removed, the card is given a good rubbing
with a clean, soft rag. It is well
to protect the hands as well as the
table during the process.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Water-Heating Coil in a Furnace Pipe

<p>
The accompanying sketch shows a
plan I adopted for conserving the
waste heat from my furnace. I found
that I was able
to put a coil into
the smoke pipe,
which was about
8&nbsp;in. in diameter,
and thus heat
water for domestic
purposes. It
will be seen that
the coil is spiral
in shape rather
than cylindrical,
as the latter
would leave a
free passage up
the center and therefore would not
bring enough gases into contact with
the coil.
</p>

<p>
In addition to this coil I have a gas
heater near the tank which is used
only in case the demand for hot water
exceeds the capacity of the coil, which
is naturally not as efficient per unit of
length as one directly within the firepot
would be. It has the advantage
of not absorbing heat which should
go to make steam, but only that which
would otherwise be wasted. The
heating surface of the coil is much
greater than would be possible within
the firepot, which in a measure compensates
for its lower efficiency.&mdash;Contributed

<p>
Screen wire is very difficult material
to fasten on a frame so that it becomes
taut.  To make
it taut and even
drive the tacks
as follows: First
tack the screen
on one side of the frame, taking
care to leave no slack between the
tacks, which should be about 1&nbsp;ft.
apart. Fasten the opposite side by
stretching the screen with one hand
and with the other place the tack
through the meshes and push the
point as far as possible toward the
outer edge of the screen frame as
shown in the sketch. Drive the tack
so that it will enter the wood straight,
which will draw the screen taut.
After having thus fastened the screen
to two opposite sides of the frame
with tacks 1&nbsp;ft. apart, other tacks are
driven in midway between the first
ones, stretching the screen and driving
the tacks as before described, until a
sufficient number of tacks are driven
into either side. Then both ends are attached
in the same manner.&mdash;Contributed

The grinding part, or cylinder, is
made of wood, 3&nbsp;in. in diameter and 9&nbsp;in. long, with 8-penny nails, spaced 3/16&nbsp;in. apart, driven partly into it and then
cut off so as to leave 1/4&nbsp;in. projecting.
The cylinder is turned by means of a
crank attached to the end of the shaft.
</p>

<p>
A hopper, B, is constructed, 4 by 9-1/2&nbsp;in. inside measurement at the bottom,
and as large as necessary at the top.
A space is provided at the bottom as
shown to receive the concave C, which
consists of a 1-in. board, 3 to 4&nbsp;in. wide
and 9&nbsp;in. long, with nails driven in and
cut off as described for the cylinder.

How to Make a Copper Stencil for Marking Laundry
</h2>


<p>
A stencil suitable for marking laundry
may be easily made as follows:
</p>

<p>
First procure a small sheet of "stencil
sheet copper," about 1&nbsp;in. wide and
4&nbsp;in. long. Dip this sheet of copper
in a vessel containing some melted
beeswax, so that both sides will be
evenly covered with a thin coat of the
wax when it cools. The design&mdash;name,
monogram or figure&mdash;that is
wanted in the stencil should now
be drawn upon a piece of thin white
paper, the reverse side of the paper
blackened with graphite, and then laid
on the stencil plate with the design in
the center of the plate, whereupon the
design is lightly traced with a blunt
point on the thin wax coating. After the
paper is removed, trace the design on
the wax surface with a pointed instrument,
but not completely, the lines
being broken at more or less regular
intervals, to form "holders" so that,
after etching, the design cannot fall out.
</p>

<p>
Next lay the stencil in a small shallow
dish and pour a small quantity of
fresh nitric acid over it. Keep the
air bubbles removed from the surface
by means of a piece of soft feather.
The design will be eaten away in a
very short time, where the wax has
been removed, and this may be readily
observed by holding the stencil plate
up to the light. The acid should then
be rinsed off with water, and the wax
removed by heating and wiping it off
with a cloth. The stencil may be
given a final cleaning in a dish of benzine
or gasoline, which will remove any
remaining wax.

A Ring Trick
</h2>


<p>
The trick to be described is one of
the simplest and at the same time one
of the most effective, and but little
"make-ready" is required to perform
it. The magician, while sitting in a
chair, allows his hands to be tied together
behind the back of the chair. A
ring is placed between his lips which
he claims to be able to slip on his
finger without untying his hands.
This, to the audience, seems practically
impossible, but it is easily accomplished.
</p>

<p>
A screen is placed in front of the
performer before the trick is started,
so that the audience will not see how
it is done. As soon as he is hidden
from view, he tilts his head forward
and drops the ring in his lap. He then
allows the ring to drop to the seat of
the chair between his legs. The chair
is tilted backward slightly, and he
raises himself to allow the ring to slip
to the back part of the chair seat,
where he catches it in his hands and
slips it on the finger. Any one finger
may be mentioned, as he can slip the
ring as readily on one as on another.
Use a leather-bottom chair, if possible,
as the least noise will then be made
when the ring is dropped.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Removing Old Putty
</h2>


<p>
A very effective way to remove old
putty from window panes or other
articles is to apply a red-hot iron, as
follows: The iron should be made of
a broken file or cold chisel and the
point heated quite hot. This is run
over the surface of the putty, which
will crack and fall off. Be careful not
to let the hot iron touch the glass, as
the heat may cause the latter to break.

How to Make a Water Wheel
</h2>


<p>
The materials used in the construction
of this water wheel are such as
the average amateur mechanic may
pick up or secure from a junk pile. The
drawings in Fig.&nbsp;1 clearly show the
way the wheel is built. The nozzle,
Fig.&nbsp;2, is made of pipe and fittings and
is adjustable to concentrate the stream
so as to get the full efficiency of the
weight and velocity of the water. The
cap on the end of the nipple is drilled
to receive the pin point filed on the
end of the 1/4-in. rod. The parts of this
nozzle are a 1/2-in. tee, connected to the
source of water supply; a plug, drilled
to snugly fit the 1/4-in. rod, and fitted
into one end of the straight part of the
tee; and a 1/2-in. nipple of sufficient
length to make the dimension shown in
the sketch. The nipple has a long
thread to receive two 1/2-in. locknuts,
which clamp the nozzle to the sheet-metal
covering, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1.

the buckets centrally with the
stream of water, and to take up any

and drilled for oil holes. The runner

the speed will be from 2,000 to 2,500
revolutions per minute with ordinary

instead of adding an extra weight, a
part of the disk is filed out on one edge.

the use of too many buckets results
in decrease of power. One bucket

a point at right angles to the stream.
The water should divide equally exactly

An Interesting Experiment

<p>
Take an ordinary board, 2 or 3&nbsp;ft.
long, such as a bread board, and place
it on the table so that about one-third
of its length will project over the edge.
Unfold a newspaper and lay it on the
table over the board as shown in the
sketch. Anyone not familiar with the
experiment would suppose the board
could be knocked off by hitting it on
the outer end. It would appear to be
easy to do, but try it. Unless you are
prepared to break the board you will
probably not be able to knock the
board off.

  <p>Striking the Board</p>
</div>

<p>
The reason is that when the board is
struck it forces the other end up and
the newspaper along with it. This
causes a momentary vacuum to be
formed under the paper, and the pressure
of the air above, which is about
15&nbsp;lb. to the square inch, prevents the
board from coming up. This is an
entertaining trick to play at an evening
party, and also makes a simple and
interesting school experiment.

<h2>
How to Make a Water Motor<br />
By Edward Silja
</h2>


<p>
After making several different styles
of water motors I found the one illustrated
to be the most powerful as well
as the simplest and most inexpensive
to make. It can be constructed in the
following manner: A disk, as shown
in Fig.&nbsp;1, cut from sheet iron or brass,
1/16&nbsp;in. thick and 9-3/4&nbsp;in. in diameter,
constitutes the main part of the wheel.
The circumference is divided into 24
equal parts, and a depth line marked
which is 8-1/4&nbsp;in. in diameter. Notches
are cut to the depth line, similar to the
teeth of a rip saw, one edge being on a
line with the center of the wheel and
the other running from the top of one
tooth to the base of the preceding tooth.
</p>

  <p>Metal Disk with a Saw-Tooth Circumference That
Constitutes the Main Body of the Wheel (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
A 1/4-in. hole is drilled in the center
of the disk and the metal strengthened
with a flange, placed on each side of
the disk and fastened with screws or
rivets. A 1/4-in. steel rod is used for the shaft.
</p>

<p>
The cups, or buckets, are shaped in
a die which can be cast or built up of
two pieces, as desired. Both of these
dies are shown in Fig.&nbsp;2. The one at
A is made of two pieces riveted together.

  </a>
  <p>Two Ways of Making the Dies to Shape the Sheet-Metal
Water Cups (Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
If a foundry is near, a pattern can be
made for a casting, as shown at B.
The die is used in the manner shown
in Fig.&nbsp;3. A strip of galvanized metal
is placed over the depressions in the
die and a ball-peen hammer used to
drive the metal into the die. Cups, or
buckets, are thus formed which are soldered
to the edge of the teeth on a
line with the center of the disk, as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. As there are 24
notches in the disk, 24 cups will be
necessary to fill them.

  <p>The Sheet Metal is Placed on the Die and Then
Hammered into Shape (Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
The cups are made in pairs or in two
sections, which is a better construction
than the single cup. The water from
the nozzle first strikes the center between
the cups, then divides and produces
a double force.
</p>

  />
  <p>The Water Cups are Fastened to the Teeth on the
Metal Disk with Solder (Fig.&nbsp;4)</p>
</div>

<p>
When this part of the work is finished
it is well to balance the wheel,
which can be done by filing off some
of the metal on the heavy side or adding
a little solder to the light side.
This will be necessary to provide an
easy-running wheel that will not cause
any unnecessary wear on the bearings.
</p>

<p>
The housing for the wheel consists
of two wood pieces, about 3/4-in. thick
and cut to the shape shown in Fig.&nbsp;5.
Grooves are cut in one surface of each
piece, to receive the edges of a strip
of galvanized metal, as shown at A.
The grooves are cut with a specially
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>[304]</a></span>
constructed saw, shown in Fig.&nbsp;6. It
consists of a piece of wood, 6&nbsp;in. long,
1-1/2&nbsp;in. wide and 1/2&nbsp;in. thick, the end
being cut on an arc of a circle whose
diameter is 10&nbsp;in. A piece of a broken
hacksaw blade is fastened with screws
to the curved end. A nail is used as a
center pivot, forming a 5-in. and a 5-3/4-in.
radius to swing the saw on in cutting
the groove. After inserting the
strip of galvanized metal, A, Fig.&nbsp;5, the
sides are clamped together with bolts
about 3-1/4&nbsp;in. long.

</p>

<p>
A bearing, D, shaped as shown, is

<h2>
An Application for Small Wounds
</h2>


<p>
Pure wintergreen oil makes a good
local application for all small wounds,
bites, scratches, abrasions, etc. There
is no germ or microbe, animal or vegetable,
dead or living, that can withstand
this oil, and at the same time it
is not injurious to living tissues. A few
drops gently rubbed in where there is
apt to be any infection is sufficient.
</p>

<p>
An infection always follows the
wound of a bullet or the scratch of a
brass pin, with irritation extending
up the limb or part threatening tetanus
or lockjaw. These symptoms are manifested
by spasmodic pains which shoot
upward, but are quickly subdued, if
the oil is applied along the track of
the pain or infection. This oil is
equally effective when locally applied
to tendons or ligaments which have
been unduly strained.
</p>

<p>
An ounce of the pure oil does not
cost much, and it should be kept in
every shop and household. If 5 or 10
per cent of olive oil is added to it, the
oil will have more body and will last
longer.&mdash;Contributed by Dr. E. R.

<h2>
Cores for Use in Babbitt Metal
</h2>


<p>
It is often necessary in making things
of babbitt metal to core out some of the
parts. A very good core is made of
common salt and glue. Mix just
enough of the glue into the salt to
make a stiff paste, which is then formed
into the desired shape or molded in a
core box and allowed to harden. This
kind of a core can be removed from
the casting by soaking it in warm
water, which will dissolve the salt and
leave the desired hole.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
How to Build a Wind Vane with an Electric Indicator
</h2>


<p>
Quite often it is practically impossible
to ascertain the direction of the
wind by observing an ordinary wind
vane on account of the necessity of locating
the vane at such a height that
it may give a true indication. By
means of the device shown in Fig.&nbsp;2,
the position of the vane may be determined
without actually looking at the
vane itself and the indicating device
may be located almost anywhere and
independently of the position of the
wind vane.

  <p>Fig.&nbsp;1&mdash;The Diagram of a Wheatstone Bridge Which
Shows the Points of Contact So Placed That a
Balance is Obtained</p>
</div>

<p>
The principle upon which the device
operates is that of the Wheatstone
bridge. The position of the moving
contact A, Fig.&nbsp;1, is controlled by the
wind vane. This contact is made to
move over a specially constructed resistance
R, Fig.&nbsp;2. A second movable
contact, B, is controlled by the observer
and moves over a second resistance,
identical with that over which the contact
A moves. These two resistances
are connected so as to form the two
main branches of a Wheatstone bridge;
the points A and B are connected to the
current-detecting device, which may
be a galvanometer or telephone receiver,
and current is supplied by a
number of dry cells.

  </a>
  <p>Fig.&nbsp;2&mdash;The Weather Vane with Resistance Coil, and
Diagram of Indicator Which is Identical with That
of the Vane</p>
</div>

<p>
In order to obtain a balance&mdash;that
is, no current through the receiver&mdash;the
points A and B must occupy corresponding
positions on their respective
resistances. If the two resistances
over which the points A and B move
are mounted in the same position with
respect to the cardinal points of the
compass, then the points themselves
will always be in the same position
with respect to the cardinal points
when a balance is obtained. The arrow
head on the wind vane and the
point A are made to occupy corresponding
positions, and hence the position
of the point B, when no current
passes through the receiver, is an indication
of the direction in which the
wind vane is pointing.
</p>

<p>
The principal parts in the construction
of the device are shown in the illustration,
and the following description
of their construction may be of interest
to those who contemplate building
the indicator.
</p>

<p>
Procure two pieces of 1/16-in. hard
rubber, 1-1/2&nbsp;in. wide by 24&nbsp;in. long.
Clamp these, side by side, between two
boards and smooth down their edges
and ends, and then file small slots in
the edges with the edge of a three-cornered
file. These slots should all
be equally spaced about 3/32&nbsp;in. apart.
Have the pieces clamped together
while filing the slots and mark one
edge top and one end right so that
the pieces may be mounted alike. Now
procure a small quantity of No. 20
gauge bare manganin wire. Fasten
one end of this wire to one end of
the pieces of rubber by winding it in
and out through three or four small
holes and then wind it around the
piece, placing the various turns in the
small slots that were filed in the edges.
After completing the winding, fasten
the end just as the starting end was
attached. Wind the second piece of
rubber in a similar manner and make
sure to have the length of the free ends
in each case the same. Obtain a cylinder
of some kind, about 8&nbsp;in. in diameter,
warm the pieces of rubber by dipping
them in hot water, bend them
around the cylinder and allow them
to cool.
</p>

<p>
A containing case, similar to that
shown in cross section in the upper
portion of Fig.&nbsp;2 should now be
constructed from a good quality of
tin or copper. The inside diameter of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>[306]</a></span>
this case should be about 1&nbsp;in. more
than the outside diameter of the resistance
ring R, and it should be about
3&nbsp;in. deep. The top C may be made
curved as shown in the illustration,
and should be fastened to the case
proper by a number of small machine
screws. The base of this case may be
made so that the whole device can be
mounted on the top of a pole.
</p>

<p>
Mount a piece of 1/4-in. steel rod,
about 1/2&nbsp;in. long, with a conical hole
in one end, in the center of the bottom
of the case as shown by M. A number
of supports, similar to the one shown,
should be made from some 1/4-in. hard
rubber and fastened to the sides of
the case, to support the resistance ring.
The dimensions of these supports
should be such that the ends of the
piece of rubber, forming the ring, are
against each other when it is in place.
The upper edge of the ring should be
about 2&nbsp;in. above the bottom of the
case.
</p>

<p>
Next, mount a piece of brass tube,
D, in the exact center of the top and
perpendicular to it. A washer, E, may
also be soldered to the top so as to
aid in holding the tube. Procure a
piece of steel rod, F, that will fit in
the tube D and turn freely. Sharpen
one end of this rod and mount a brass
wind vane on the other end. A small
metal cup, G, may be soldered to a
washer, H, and the whole mounted on
the steel rod F in an inverted position
as shown, which will prevent water
from getting down inside the case
along the rod. The cup G may be
soldered directly to the rod. Make a
small arm, J, of brass, and fasten a
piece of light spring, K, to one side
of it, near the outer end, then mount
the arm on the steel rod so that it is
parallel to the vane and its outer end
points in the same direction as the arrow
on the vane. The free end of the
light spring on the arm J should be
broad enough to bridge the gap between
adjacent turns of wire on the
resistance ring. Four bindings should
then be mounted on the inside of the
case and all insulated from it with the
exception of number 1. Numbers 2
and 3 are connected to the ends of the
winding and number 4 is connected to
number 3.
</p>

<p>
A second outfit should now be constructed,
identical with the one just
described except that it should have
a flat top with a circular scale mounted
on it, and the arm L should be controlled
by a small handle in the center
of the scale. The position of the contact
B may be indicated on the scale
by a slender pointer, attached to the
handle controlling the arm L.
</p>

<p>
Four leads of equal resistance should
be used in connecting the two devices
and the connections made as shown.
An ordinary buzzer placed in the battery
circuit will produce an interrupted
current through the bridge circuit and
a balance will be obtained by adjusting
the contact point B until a minimum
hum is heard in the telephone receiver.

done away with by fastening two
strips of wood in a V-shape to the floor
beneath the refrigerator. When the
pan is shoved under, it will strike one
strip and slide along until it strikes the
other. Then the pan is sure to be under
the drip pipe.&mdash;Contributed by

<h2>
Windmill for Light Power
</h2>


<p>
The windmill shown in the sketch
is one that will always face the wind,
and it never requires adjustment. It
consists of a vertical shaft, A, provided
with a number of arms, B, on which
are hinged square sails, C. These sails
are preferably made of wood frames
covered with canvas. They are provided
with hinges, D, attached to the
ends of the arms in such a way that
they offer resistance to the wind on
one side of the wheel, while they move
edgewise against the wind on the other
side, as shown. The shaft of the mill
can either be run in bearings set on
an upright post, the lower end of the
shaft turning on a conical bearing, or
collars may be used on the bearings to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308' href='#Page_308'>[308]</a></span>
keep it in position. The power can be
transmitted with gears or by a flat belt
over a pulley.

Draw a glass tube to the shape shown,
to produce a fine
hollow point.
Mark carefully
with a file and
break at A and
then at B. Bore
or burn a hole
in a cork to fit
the tube. Cut a
V-shaped notch
in the side of
the cork extending
to the hole.
Bend the lower
tube at right
angles and insert
it in a wood
block, previously slotted with a saw
to make a snug fit. A little glue will
hold the glass tubes, cork and base
together. The air mixture can be adjusted
by sliding the upper tube before
the glue sets.

<h2>
The Hindoo Sand Trick
</h2>


<p>
This is one of the many tricks for
which the Hindoos are famous, and
was long kept a secret by them. It
consists of placing ordinary sand in a
basin full of water, stirring the water
and taking out the sand in handfuls
perfectly dry. It need scarcely be said
that without previous preparation, it is
impossible to do so.
</p>

<p>
Take 2&nbsp;lb. of fine silver sand, place it
in a frying pan and heat well over a
clear fire. When the sand is thoroughly
heated, place a small piece of
grease or wax&mdash;the composition of a
paraffin candle preferred&mdash;in the sand,
stirring it well to get it thoroughly
mixed, then allow the sand to cool.
When this sand is placed in a basin of
water, it will be apparently dry when
taken out. It is very important that
only a small portion of the adherent
be used so that it cannot be detected
when the sand is examined by the audience.
The explanation is that the
grease or wax coating on each sand
particle repels the water.&mdash;Contributed

The parachute should have a small

in the wire&mdash;should be attached to the
kite string a few feet from the kite.
When the parachute is carried up the

<h2>
Tying a Rosette in a Couch-Cover Corner
</h2>


<p>
In the accompanying illustration is
shown a very simple method of tying
a rosette in the corner of a couch
cover. The use of the average couch
cover as a throw-over leaves a large
corner which drags upon the floor. To
dispose of this extra length and at the
same time make an artistic corner, the
Upholsterer suggests the following method:

  <p>Different Stages in Tying the Rosette (Fig.&nbsp;1, Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
Spread the couch cover on the couch
so that the surplus is evenly divided
between the sides and ends, and pass
a pin through the cover to show each
corner as in Fig.&nbsp;1. Measure the distance
from each corner of the couch
to the floor, Fig.&nbsp;2, and measuring
from the point of the corner, mark the
same distance by the insertion of another
pin, repeating in all four corners.
The distance between the two pins at
each corner now defines the amount of
surplus that is to be taken up. Chalk
a circle to include the portion between
these two pins, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;3, and
with a circular needle and stout stitching
twine run a shirring thread around
the circle, and when this is drawn
tightly and tied, the surplus is formed
into a rosette, while the corner may
be draped into an artistic cascade, as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;4.

<h2>
A Power Windmill
</h2>


<p>
The windmill shown is somewhat
different from the ordinary kind. It
is not a toy, nor does it approach in
size the ordinary farm windmill, but
is a compromise between the two, and
in a good strong wind, will supply
power enough to run a washing machine,
a small dynamo, an emery
wheel, or any other device used in
the home workshop. The wheel is
about 5&nbsp;ft. in diameter, with eight
blades. The over-all length is about
6 feet.
</p>

<p>
The windmill is easily made and
the cost is within the means of the
average boy. There is not a part used
in its construction that cannot be
found about an ordinary manual-training
shop. The most difficult parts of
the construction will be described in
detail. Symmetry and smoothness of
design should be preserved and the
parts made as light as possible consistent
with strength and durability.

  <p> The Hub Consists of Two Parts, Each Having Four
Arms for Holding the Blades (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>


<h3>
The Wheel
</h3>

<p>
As shown in the drawings, the wheel
has eight blades. Ordinarily the use
of eight blades makes it difficult to
construct a hub of sufficient strength
to carry them. Where so many blades
radiate from a common center it is
almost impossible to provide an
anchorage for each blade. To provide
a maximum of strength coupled with
simplicity of design, the plan of using
two hubs of four arms each was
adopted in the construction of this
mill. The ordinary hub of four arms
is simple to make and quite strong.
Four pieces of straight-grained oak,
each 16&nbsp;in. long and 1-7/8&nbsp;in. square, are
used in constructing the hubs. The
manner of notching each pair of pieces
together is shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. The
slope for the blades is made to run
in opposite directions on the ends of
each crosspiece. The slope is formed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>[312]</a></span>
by cutting out a triangular piece, as shown.
</p>

  <img src='images/img311b2.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>(Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
The two hubs, thus formed, are
mounted on the shaft, one behind the
other, in such positions that the arms
will be evenly divided for space in the
wheel circle. These details are shown
in Fig.&nbsp;2. The blades, Fig.&nbsp;3, are
made of thin basswood or hard maple,
and each is fastened in its place by
means of two 3/8-in. bolts, in addition
to which a few brads are driven in to
prevent the thin blades from warping.

<h3>
The Gears
</h3>

<p>
This windmill was designed to
transmit power by means of shafts
and gear wheels, rather than with
cranks and reciprocating pump rods,
such as are used on ordinary farm
mills. To obtain this result, an old
sewing machine head was used. Such
a part can be obtained from a junk
dealer or a sewing-machine agent.
The head is stripped of its base plate
with the shuttle gearing; likewise the
needle rod, presser foot, etc., are taken
from the front end of the head along
with the faceplate. The horizontal
shaft and gear wheel are taken out
and the bearings reamed out for a
1/2-in. shaft, which is substituted. The
shaft should be 2&nbsp;ft. in length, and 8
or 10&nbsp;in. of its outer end threaded for
the clamping nuts which hold the two
hubs in place, as shown at A and B,
Fig.&nbsp;2. The gear wheel is also bored
out and remounted on the new shaft.

  <p>The Supporting Standard
Holds the Machine Head
with the Wheel and the
Vane on an Axis (Fig.&nbsp;4)</p>
</div>

<p>
The supporting standard is constructed
of oak, with mortise-and-tenon
joints, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. The
width of the pieces will depend on
the kind of sewing-machine head used.
It may be necessary also to slightly
change the dimensions. The machine
head is fastened on the support with
bolts. A sleeve and thrust spring are
mounted on the shaft, as shown. The
sleeve is made of brass tubing, of a
size to fit snugly on the shaft. A
cotter will keep it in place. The sleeve
serves as a collar for the thrust spring,
which is placed between the sleeve
and the standard. This arrangement
acts as a buffer to take up the end
thrust on the shaft caused by the
varying pressure of the wind on the wheel.

  <p>(Fig.&nbsp;5)</p>
</div>


<h3>
The Vane
</h3>

<p>
To keep the wheel facing the wind
at all times, a vane must be provided.
It is made of basswood or hard maple,
as shown in Fig.&nbsp;5. It is not built up
solid, air spaces being left between
the slats to reduce the wind resistance.
Unless built in this manner, the vane
is liable to twist off in a gale. The
horizontal slats are 1/4&nbsp;in. thick, and
the upright and cross braces 3/8&nbsp;in.
thick, while the long arm connecting
the vane to the supporting standard is
1/2&nbsp;in. thick.
</p>

<p>
The supporting standard, carrying
the wheel and the vane, must revolve
about a vertical axis with the changes
in the wind, and this vertical axis is
supplied in the form of a piece of gas
pipe which runs through the supporting
standard at the points marked C
and D, Fig.&nbsp;4. Ordinary pipe fittings,
called flanges, are bolted to the frame
at these points. The coupling in the
gas pipe beneath the supporting standard
serves as a stationary collar to
support the weight of the whole mill.
The vane should be placed correctly
to balance the weight of the wheel.
</p>

<p>
The shaft passes through the framework
of the mill on the inside of the
pipe, as shown at E. A 3/8-in. soft-steel
or wrought-iron rod is satisfactory
for the shaft, as no weight is
supported by it and only a twisting
force is transmitted. The use of a
larger rod makes the mill cumbersome
and unwieldy. The upper end of the
shaft is fastened to the shaft that projects
from the under side of the machine
head by means of a sleeve made
of a piece of 3/8-in. pipe. Two cotters
hold the shafts and sleeve together.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img313f6'>
  <img src='images/img313f6.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Lower End of the Shaft has a Horizontal Shaft
Geared to It for the Drive Pulleys (Fig.&nbsp;6)</p>
</div>

<p>
At the lower end of the shaft, inside
the workshop, the device shown in
Fig.&nbsp;6 is installed. The purpose of
this appliance is to provide a horizontal
shaft upon which pulleys or driving
gears may be mounted. The
device is constructed of another sewing-machine
head similar to the one
already described. The head is cut in
two and the separate parts mounted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>[313]</a></span>
on suitable supports. The gap between
the sawed portions permits a
pulley to be fastened on the shaft to
serve as the main drive. The wheel
propelled by the treadle of the sewing
machine will make a good drive
wheel. The small handwheel, originally
mounted on the machine-head shaft,
is left intact. This arrangement gives
two sizes of drive wheels. Heavy
sewing-machine belts will serve to
transmit the power.
</p>


<h3>
The Tower
</h3>

<p>
The tower can be built up in any
manner to suit the conditions. Ordinarily
sticks, 2&nbsp;in. square, are suitable.
These are well braced with wire and
fastened securely to the roof of the
shop. The arrangement of the tower
with the mill is shown in Fig.&nbsp;7.

Telegraph Code on Typewriter Keys

<p>
A very simple and practical method
of transcribing wireless time and other
messages on the typewriter without
having such perfect knowledge of the
Morse system as to be able to immediately
translate it into the common
alphabet is the following: The characters
of the Morse system are inscribed
on small slips of paper&mdash;thus,
three dots (...), for the letter S; two
dashes (&mdash;), for the letter M, etc.&mdash;and
these slips are pasted on the corresponding
keys of the typewriter.
The operator puts on his receiver, and
the proper key is struck as he hears
the corresponding Morse letter. As
there are no capitals, spacing between
words, or even punctuation, the manipulation
of the typewriter is much
simplified, and it is easily learned to
record the signals as fast as they are heard.

An Aid in Sketching Profiles
</h2>


<p>
The means usually employed by
most beginners to obtain the correct
outline of an object, such as tracing or
a pantograph, make them dependent
on mechanical help rather than train
the eye to form and proportion a drawing
correctly. The device shown not
only greatly assists the beginner, but
actually trains him toward a point
where he can dispense with any such
device and correctly sketch by free
hand. It also has the effect of encouraging
the beginner, because his
first efforts will not be complete failures,
as is usually the case.

  <p>The Fine Wire is Bent as Near as
Possible to the Outline of the Object</p>
</div>

<p>
The device consists of a rather fine
wire bent in the shape of a human
profile and supported on a stand or
base. The stand may be dispensed
with, however, and the wire held in
the hand. In use, it is placed near the
model or person whose profile is to be
drawn; then, after closing one eye, it
is set at a position where it will correspond
to the features of the model.
This enables one to note the variations
between the wire and the model's
features. For instance, the forehead
may recede from the wire at the
top, or the nose may have a different
slant or shape.
</p>

<p>
The paper on which the drawing is
to be made should have a faint outline
drawn by laying the wire upon it
and marking around it with a soft pencil.
Having noted the variations between
the wire and the features,
proceed to draw the profile, observing
the same variations, and when the
sketch is completed, erase the faint
outlines. Then compare the drawing
with the model without using the
wire, and make final corrections. The
dotted line indicates the outline to be erased.
</p>

<p>
The drawing may be made larger or
smaller than the bent wire, but the
outline on the paper must be kept in
exactly the same proportion. It is not
necessary that the wire be bent so that
it represents perfect features. With
the use of this device one forms a habit
of comparing and proportioning, which
applies to the correct sketching of all
objects.&mdash;Contributed by Will L. Burner,

  <p>Layout for the Casing, Cover and Wheel for
the Construction of a Hydraulic Motor That will Drive a Small Dynamo, to
Produce Current for Experimental Purposes, to Charge Storage Cells or to
Run Electric Toys (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
The motor casing is shown in Fig.
1. It is made with a wide flange so
that the cover plate can be bolted to
it. The lug A is to give additional
strength and thickness to the side so
that it may be drilled and tapped for
the nozzle. The legs B and C are for
bolting the case to a base or support.
The outlet pipe is of lead, 1-3/4&nbsp;in. outside
diameter, and the hole for it in the
case can be either drilled or cored.
Solder the pipe flush with the inside
of the casing. Drill and tap the holes
around the flange for 8,32 bolts. The
shaft hole must be drilled very carefully.
Drill 1/4-in. holes in the feet.
The oil holes are 1/8&nbsp;in. in diameter.
File the surface of the flange smooth
and also the inside shoulder of the
bearing lug. Drill and tap the nozzle
hole for a 3/4-in. pipe thread.

This is bolted to the casing with 8,32
brass bolts, 1/2&nbsp;in. long. The holes for
them are drilled 3/16&nbsp;in. in diameter. A
shallow hole, for the end of the shaft
to fit in, is drilled in the lug, as shown.
It does not pass all the way through
the plate. File the inside face of the
lug smooth and also the edge of the
plate where it joins the casing.

  <p>The Best Shape of the Buckets to Take Up
the Force of the Water (Fig.&nbsp;4)</p>
</div>

<p>
The buckets are shown in Fig.&nbsp;4.
They may be cast from iron or babbitt.
The sharp ridge in the center
provides for a deviation of the water
jet as it flows on the bucket. The
ridge divides the bucket into two
equal lobes which turn each division
of the jet through almost 180&nbsp;deg.,
using all the kinetic energy in the jet.
This is shown at D. The dividing
ridge must lie in the plane of the revolution,
so that each bucket will enter
the center of the jet. The buckets
being evenly spaced on the periphery
of the wheel, only one at a time receives
the force of the jet, the one in
front and the one behind clearing the jet.

The nozzle is shown in Fig.&nbsp;5. It
can be made of iron or brass. The
inside gradually tapers from 3/4 to 3/16&nbsp;in. It has a 3/4-in. pipe thread and is
screwed into the hole in the case from
the inside and is secured with a lock
nut. Enough additional threaded portion
is left protruding to allow the
supply pipe to be connected.

<p>
When assembling the motor, fasten
the wheel to the shaft with the two
setscrews, and place a metal washer,
E, on each side of the wheel. Place
the wheel in the casing and screw the

wood base, which in turn is firmly
bolted to a concrete foundation. Level
up the two machines by the use of thin
washers on the bolts between the base
and machine. A heavy sleeve and setscrews
are used to connect the two
shafts. The connection to the water
supply is made with 3/4-in. pipe, with
a globe valve in it to regulate the flow
of water. Any dynamo of about 100-watt
output can be used.

<h2>
Paper Shades for Electric-Light Globes
</h2>


<p>
The appearance of an electric-light
globe can be very prettily improved by
making a shade of cr&ecirc;pe paper of any
desired color for each one. Canary-colored
cr&ecirc;pe produces a soft, mellow
effect. Pale blue, yellow, red and, in
fact, all the colors can be used, making
a very pleasing variety.

  <p>Two Pieces of Cr&ecirc;pe Paper Stitched Together and
Ruffled, to Make a Fancy Electric-Light Shade</p>
</div>

<p>
The body of the shade is made of a
piece of paper about 5-1/2&nbsp;in. wide and
3-1/2&nbsp;ft. long. The width will vary with
the length of the globe to be covered,
and it is best to have it full, as the edge
can be trimmed even with the lower
end of the globe afterward. Another
piece of the same color is cut 2-1/2&nbsp;in.
wide and of the same length. This
piece makes the ruffle.
</p>

<p>
The smaller piece is placed on the
larger centrally, and both are stitched
together with a running stitch, using a
needle and cotton thread. A plain running
stitch is also made 1/4&nbsp;in. from one
edge of the larger strip. The material
is gathered along both threads. This
operation makes the material shrink in
length. Wrap it around the globe,
pulling the threads taut so that the
ends of the paper will just meet. Tie
the threads and clip off the extending
ends. If the paper extends beyond the
end of the globe, trim it off with
the shears. Ruffle the two edges of the
narrow strip and the lower edge of the
larger one. This operation is simply
stretching the edge of the cr&ecirc;pe to
cause it to stand out.&mdash;Contributed by

Renewing the Markings on Graduates
</h2>


<p>
Graduates that have been in use a
long time, especially for measuring
alkalies, become unreadable. The graduations
are easily restored in the following
manner: Moisten a small piece
of absorbent cotton with a solution of
white shellac, cut in alcohol. Rub this
well into all the etched parts and allow
to dry for about two minutes, then rub
in a fine whiting or litharge with an
old toothbrush. If red is desired, use
rouge; if black is preferred, use lampblack
or powdered graphite. When
dry, wipe off the excess pigment with
a cloth moistened in alcohol.&mdash;Contributed

Repairing a Broken Ball-Clasp Purse

</div>

<p>
Having occasion to repair a purse of
the ordinary ball-clasp kind where one
of the stems was broken off and lost,
I first had some
trouble in finding
a way to
repair  it.  I
started to take
off the remaining
stem in an
attempt to replace the locking device
with another kind, and in bending it
down toward the opposite side, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' name='Page_317' href='#Page_317'>[317]</a></span>
happened to close the purse and found
that it locked just as well as if there
had been two balls on it. I have since
repaired two other purses in the same
manner and found that they worked well.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to bend the remaining
clasp over until it is low enough to
come in contact with and to spring
over the other side, thus giving the
same snap and holding qualities as
before.&mdash;Contributed by W. C. Loy,

</div>

<p>
Where liquid is run through a funnel
into an opaque bottle or earthen
jug, the filling cannot be watched, and
if not watched constantly,
the vessel
will overflow. This
can be obviated by
applying the automatic
valve to the
funnel stem, as
shown. A washer
support is soldered
or otherwise fastened
in the upper
end of the stem, or
at the base of the
sloping part, and a
crossbar is fastened to its upper surface
across the hole. The crossbar is
centrally drilled to receive a small rod
or wire, to which is attached a valve
that will cover the hole in the washer.
A cork is stuck on the lower end of
the rod. The location of the cork on
the rod should be at a point a little below
the level to which the bottle or
vessel is to be filled.&mdash;Contributed by

<h2>
Chisel Holder for Whetting
</h2>


<p>
To obtain the proper slope and apply
a fine cutting edge, the plane iron
or chisel must be held at the proper
slope while grinding, and especially
so when whetting. The illustration
shows a holder to keep the iron or
chisel at the proper slope. It consists
of a block of wood with a sloping
cut at the right angle to make two
pieces. One of these pieces is permanently
fastened to the strip at the back,
while the other is held with a bolt
passing through a notch in the strip
for adjusting or clamping. The rear
end of the back piece is fitted with a
large screw hook or L-hook to provide
a slide to keep the rear end of the
holder at the right height. The iron
or chisel is inserted between the sloping
edges of the blocks and clamped
in place, then the L-screw is adjusted
for height to secure the proper angle
on the stone. It is then only necessary
to move the block and tool back
and forth over the stone.

if carefully cut as shown by the lines
in the sketch, one will find with surprise
that the paper can be extended
so that the feat is easily accomplished.
Make the cuts about 1/8&nbsp;in. apart and
these will allow the paper to expand
several times its size.&mdash;Contributed by

<h2>
Homemade Bunsen Burner
</h2>


<p>
The amateur craftsman, at some
time or other, needs a hot flame for certain
kinds of work, and a Bunsen or
alcohol flame is brought into service.
The gasoline and alcohol flames have
their drawbacks, one of which is the
starting of the burner and the waiting
for the heat. They are also unhandy
in directing the flame on parts of the
work. As I desired a burner for quick
work and one whose flame I could direct
at any angle, for repouss&eacute; and
chasing on copper and silversmith's
work, I made the one shown in the
sketch to attach to a hose and connected
it with the gas pipe of the illuminating
system in the house. It
consists of a hose connection into
which a piece of pipe, 5&nbsp;in. long, is
fitted. The hose connection is also
fitted with a small nozzle, A, for the
gas, and the pipe has an opening
through it at the end of the nozzle.&mdash;Contributed

located above the left, cords being
passed through them, down along the
casing to a point within easy reach,
and fastened in any manner desired.

to do this with the use of some old
worn-out and discarded files that had
good cutting edges. A piece of sheet
copper, about the same length as the
files, was bent to fit over one edge and
both sides of the file, allowing both
edges to project about 1/4&nbsp;in. This
made a guide that prevented the edge
of the file from slipping off the end of
the wire. The guide was held in place
on the file by cutting a slit in the projecting
edges, about 1/4&nbsp;in. from the
end, and turning these separated parts
back on the file.

<p>
The drum A is a piece of wood, 1-3/4&nbsp;in. long and 1-3/16&nbsp;in. in diameter, supported
on the end of a round stick, B,
which can be made in one piece with
the drum, if a wood lathe is at hand,
but a piece cut from a curtain pole
and a lead pencil inserted in a hole
bored in the end will answer the purpose.
Be sure to have the diameter of
the drum 1-3/16&nbsp;inches.

  <p>The Parts for Making the Revolving Drum

</div>

<p>
Provide a base piece, C, 1/2&nbsp;in. thick
and 2&nbsp;in. square, and fasten a piece of
cardboard having a slit E, as shown.
The cardboard should be 2&nbsp;in. wide
and 2-1/2&nbsp;in. high, the slit being cut 1/2&nbsp;in. in width, 1/4&nbsp;in. from the top and
3/4&nbsp;in. from the bottom. A hole is
bored in the center of the block to
admit the standard B easily.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to provide the picture
and attach it to the drum. A picture
of a boy pounding cobblestones is
shown in the sketch, at F, which should
be made on a strip of paper 4-3/8&nbsp;in.
long. This is glued or attached with
rubber bands to the drum. The drawing
can be enlarged in pen and ink, or
can be reproduced as it is, if a hand
camera is at hand, and a print used on

The flywheel on a sewing machine

in its edges, through which strings are
run to hold it to the rim of the wheel.
The chamois can then be removed or
left on the wheel as desired. Run the
machine and hold the nail on the buffer.
When there is a free wheel on the

Dip-Plating Process
</h2>


<p>
The various ways of doing dip plating
are practically the same method,
the coating fluid consisting of essentially
the same materials.
</p>

<p>
The tank or crucible, as it may be
called, consists of a piece of 3-in. gas
pipe, 9&nbsp;in. long, threaded at both ends,
one end being fitted with a screw cap
and the other with a pipe flange. This
part is shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. A piece of
sheet metal is cut in the shape shown
in Fig.&nbsp;2 and bent to form a cone, so
that the smaller end will fit snugly
around the pipe and the base be 9&nbsp;in.
in diameter. The joined edges are
riveted together. The assembled parts
will appear as shown in Fig.&nbsp;3.
</p>

<p>
The metal used for plating consists
of bismuth, 4&nbsp;oz.; antimony, 4&nbsp;oz., and
pure block tin, 10&nbsp;lb. Place the antimony
in the crucible and melt it, then
add the tin and bismuth. A flame from
an ordinary gasoline burner will be
sufficient to heat the crucible.
</p>

<p>
Clean the article to be coated by
rinsing it in strong caustic potash,
which will remove all grime and
grease, then dip it in a strong solution
of sal ammoniac and water. Dry
it and then dip it in the melted metal,
allowing it to remain there about 1
minute, then remove and plunge it in
a bath made of 1&nbsp;lb. of sal ammoniac
and 1 gal. of water. The article is then
dried in sawdust.

core to make a slot 3/4&nbsp;in. wide. A
1/4-in. hole is then bored through the
prongs to receive a stove bolt that
connects them with the lever. The
post is fastened with screws and glue
in a notch cut in the center of the base end.
</p>

<p>
The lever C is made of a piece of
wood 1/4&nbsp;in. square and 10&nbsp;in. long.
At the forward end the sides are pared
away to form a tongue, or tenon, that
will pass between the prongs of the
upright, and a hole is bored through it
to match those in the prongs. The entire
upper surface of the lever is rounded
and the under surface is rounded,
beginning 6&nbsp;in. from the tenon end.
Glue to the under side of the lever a
block, D, at the end of the under, flat
surface. The block should be about
1-1/4&nbsp;in. square by 1-1/2&nbsp;in. long. If the
under side of the base is crowning,
either level it with a plane or nail
cleats across the ends for feet. A
washer is used with the stove bolt in
connecting the lever and post.
</p>

<p>
The cuts are made of small blocks
of wood, about 3/4&nbsp;in. thick and of a
size to take the characters desired.
These blocks must be level and the
printing side made smooth with very
fine sandpaper, or a scraper, before the
characters are laid out. Boxwood is
best for cuts, but pearwood, applewood,
birch, or maple will do very
well. Mark out the characters backward,
using the pencil very lightly.
Then, with the small blade of a knife,
made as sharp as possible, cut around
the outlines, holding the knife slanting,
and remove the adjacent wood by
cutting in at a reverse angle to meet
the boundary cut. Gradually deepen
the cuts around the characters until
they stand in relief about 1/8&nbsp;in., then
score V-shaped grooves, checkerboard
fashion, across the remaining high
surface that is not a part of the design,
and chip out the resulting small
blocks to bring the entire secondary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' name='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>[328]</a></span>
surface of the block to a uniform level
with the portions adjoining the characters.
</p>

<p>
A touch of glue to the back of the cut
will set it securely enough to the bottom
of the block D for printing, and
allow its removal without injury when
desired. To get a uniform impression
in printing, place paper on the base, as
at E, to the thickness required. For
controlling the printing position on
the stock paper, pins or tacks can be
stuck into the base and each sheet to
be printed laid against these guides.&mdash;Contributed

An Electrical Testing Instrument for Experimenters
</h2>


<p>
The amateur having an ordinary
flash light can make an instrument that
will serve for a variety of purposes.
It is only necessary to solder a piece
of lamp cord to the spring of the battery
which comes in contact with the
lamp, and pass the end through a hole
drilled in the top of the case. The end
can be fitted with a cord tip.

  <p>An Instrument Made of an Electrical Pocket Flash
Light for Testing Circuits and Instruments</p>
</div>

<p>
To test batteries, take the flash
light in the right hand and press the
button, lighting the lamp, then place
the bottom of the flash light on one
binding post and the cord on the other.
If the light burns brilliantly, the battery
is dead, but if it burns dimly or
goes out the battery is good.
</p>

<p>
It may happen that the experimenter's
telegraph line is out of order and
the trouble cannot be found. The
sounder may be tested out by disconnecting
the wires from the instrument
and placing the bottom of the
flash light on one binding post and
the cord on the other. If the light
goes out, the trouble does not lie in the
sounder, but in some other part of the
line. The line may be tested in a
similar manner if one end is short-circuited
and the flash light connected
to the other.
</p>

<p>
A tester of this kind cannot be used
on long lines, or on instruments of
much resistance, as their resistance
will overcome that of the light. Keep
in mind the fact that the lamp will always
burn on an open circuit and go
out on a closed circuit.

<h2>
A Musical Doorbell<br />
By H. Marcelle
</h2>


<p>
In the construction of this doorbell
it is best to purchase a small instrument
known as the "tubaphone."
It consists of a rack with several pieces
of brass tubing cut to different lengths
to give the proper tones as they are
struck. Such an instrument with eight
tubes will play almost any tune, and
can be purchased from 50 cents up, depending
on the size. Brass tubes can
be purchased, cut, and toned, but the
time taken in doing this is worth more
than the price of the instrument, and
no changes are necessary in it to make
the doorbell.

  <p>Detail of the
Parts for the
Construction
of a Musical
Doorbell That
will Play the
Music on Brass Tubes
with One Touch of a
Push Button</p>
</div>

<p>
Several strips of pine, 2&nbsp;in. wide and
7/8&nbsp;in. thick, are procured for the framework.
The tubes are
placed on a table top, 1&nbsp;in.
apart and with their lower
ends on a line at right
angles to their length.
Allow a space of 1&nbsp;in. outside the first
and last tube, and cut a piece of the
wood to this length, allowing sufficient
additional material to fasten on the
ends of two uprights, which are cut
long enough to admit the longest tube
and allow sufficient room for a large
roller and space at the top to swing the
tubes.
</p>

<p>
A base is cut from a board, 7/8&nbsp;in.
thick and of sufficient size to admit the
roller and tube rack, together with a
small battery motor. The tube rack
is fastened to the back of this base by
making a tenon on the lower end of
each upright, and a mortise in the baseboard
to receive it.
</p>

<p>
A roller is turned from a piece of soft
pine, large enough to provide room on
its surface for a number of horizontal
lines equal to the
number of notes in
the composition to
be played. These
lines should not be
too close together. Supposing the
music it is desired to play has 15 notes
in its composition, then 15 horizontal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_330' name='Page_330' href='#Page_330'>[330]</a></span>
lines must be spaced evenly on the surface
of the roller. The length of the
roller should be a free-working fit between
the uprights. A 1/4-in. steel rod
is run through its center for a shaft,
allowing sufficient ends for the bearings,
and, in addition, at one end sufficient
length for a pulley.
</p>

<p>
The motor is lined up on the base, so
that its pulley wheel will run a belt on
the large wheel of the roller. The current
is turned on after making belt and
wiring connections, a lead pencil is held
directly centering the place where each
tube hangs, and a line is drawn on the
circumference of the roller.
</p>

<p>
A 1/8-in. hole is drilled through each
tube, near one end, and a piece of catgut
string run into it to make a hanger.
A piece of board, long enough to fit
between the uprights when placed on
the slope formed by the upper ends of
the tubes after their lower ends are set
straight on a line at right angles to
their length, and wide enough to swing
the tubes clear of the frame, is fastened
in place, as shown. Small screw
eyes are turned into the under side of
this board, at even spacings of 1&nbsp;in.,
and used to swing the tubes by the catgut
strings. Another piece of board,
the same width as the former, is placed,
perfectly horizontal, between the uprights
a short distance above the lower
ends of the hanging tubes. Evenly
spaced holes are bored in this crosspiece
to admit the ends of the tubes.
The holes should be of such size that
when they are lined with a piece of felt,
the tubes will have a little play without
touching the sides at any point.
</p>

<p>
The hammers are each made of a
strip of sheet brass, having a length
that will extend from the base to a
short distance above the lower ends of
the tubes. A hole is drilled in each
end of the strip, the lower one being
of a size to fasten it to the base crosspiece
with a round-head wood screw.
The hole in the upper end is used to
fasten a small block of wood with a
screw, for the hammer head. A small
strip of felt is glued to the striking side
of the block. Another piece of brass,
used for a trip, is fastened to the center
part of each long piece with rivets, so
that its upper end will be near the center
of the roller for height, and strike
the end of a small peg driven into the
roller. The length of these pieces, in
fact, of all pieces, will depend on the
length of the tubes in the tubaphone
and the size roller required for the music.
</p>

<p>
The setting of the pegs in the roller
requires some patience in order to get
the tune correct, but one mistake will
be of more value than an hour's description.
The pegs can be procured
from a shoemaker. If the roller is of
pine, they can be driven into the wood
of the roller with a hammer.
</p>

  <p>The Appearance of the Doorbell Is That of a
Mission Clock on a Mantel</p>
</div>

<p>
With ordinary connections to the
push button and motor, the mechanism
will only run while the push button is
being pressed. A device that will
cause the piece of music to be played
through to the finish after the push button
is pushed for a short time, consists
of a turned piece of wood fastened to
the outside surface of the driving wheel
on the roller. This piece of wood
should be carefully set, so that its outside
surface will be true as it revolves.
Three brushes, made of copper strips,
are fastened to the base. The length
of these brushes will depend on the
size of the roller and height of the block
of wood. They should be evenly
spaced and fastened, so that they will
be insulated from each other. One
strip of brass, or copper, is fastened
around the turned piece of wood. This
strip must be as wide as two brushes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_331' name='Page_331' href='#Page_331'>[331]</a></span>
except for a short distance to make a
break in the electrical circuit. The
notch in the strip, to make this break,
should be on the outside edge where it
will disconnect the center brush, and
its location on the turned piece of wood
should be on a line with the end and
the beginning of the pegs for the music.
Another short strip is fastened to the
turned piece of wood, where it will
make a contact with the first brush
when the second or middle brush is in
the notch, or disconnected, and is connected
to the other notched strip with
a piece of wire run beneath the wood.
</p>

<p>
The wiring shown will make it possible
to start the motor with the push
button which will turn the roll far
enough to connect the center brush;
then the roller will turn until the music
is played, at which point it will stop
and remain in rest until the push button
again makes the contact.
</p>

<p>
The entire mechanism can be made
to set on the mantel or shelf, incased
like a mission clock, and the wires running
to it may be concealed.

Drying Towels in Photographer's Dark Room
</h2>


<p>
In doing a large amount of photographic
work the towel becomes wet,
and to dry the hands on it is impossible.
To obviate this annoyance, I
made a galvanized-iron pipe, about 2&nbsp;ft. long and 8&nbsp;in. in diameter, with a
disk, or circular piece, of metal about
10&nbsp;in. in diameter soldered on each end
to form flanges. One flange was fastened
to the wall of the dark room in a
convenient place to support the device.
On the inside of the spool, or towel
support, an ordinary incandescent
electric globe was placed. The heat of
the lamp would easily dry 12&nbsp;in. of
the towel, and when the dry part was
pulled down for use another wet portion
was brought into position for drying.

  <p>The Alarm Clock in Its Case and the Location
of the Contact Pins and Contact Lever (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
In the construction of this clock one
perfectly good and accurate alarm
clock and the works of an old or discarded
one are used. The clock for the
accurate time is set into a frame, or
casing, made of thin boards which have
a circular opening cut in them to fit
snugly on the outside casing of the
clock. The back of the clock and casing
are shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. A circular line
is drawn on the casing, about 1&nbsp;in.
larger in diameter than the clock, and
brass machine screws with two nuts
clamping on the wood back, as shown
at A, are set at intervals so as to be opposite,
or just back of, the hour marks
2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12. A contact
spring, B, is shaped as shown and soldered
to the knurled knob on the back
of the clock used for setting the hands
in a position where it will travel or be
parallel with the minute hand. The
end of the contact spring should be
shaped so that it will slide over the
points of the screws easily, but in good
contact. The ends of the screws should
be filed to a slightly rounding point.
The wiring diagram for this part of
the apparatus is clearly shown, and the
terminals are connected to binding
posts C and D. The binding post E is
connected to the metal part of the clock.
</p>

  <p>Location of the Clock Works, Magnets, Binding
Posts, Gongs and Strikers on the Baseboard (Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
The chime part is made entirely separate
and can be located at any reasonable
distance from the clock. It is
propelled by the works from an old
clock, as shown at F, Fig.&nbsp;2. The old
clock is prepared for use by removing
the hands, balance wheel and escapement
so that the wheels will turn
freely. To prevent the works from
running too fast, a piece of sheet brass,
G, is soldered to the shaft running at
the highest speed. The brass should
be as large as the space will admit. It
forms a fan to catch the air and retard
the speed, and also provides a
means of stopping the works by the
electric mechanism.
</p>

<p>
The parts for the gongs and electrical
apparatus are supported on a
baseboard, 3/4&nbsp;in. thick, 6&nbsp;in. wide, and
18&nbsp;in. long. The automatic switch is
located at one end of the base, and
consists of two sets of magnets, H and
J, with an armature, K, to which is
attached a stiff contact wire, L. This
wire is to make contact with the spring
M when the armature is drawn by the
magnets J, and with N when drawn by
the magnets H. The springs M and N
are made of thin sheet brass, bent as
shown, and mounted on the base.
</p>

<p>
A piece of wood, O, on which to
mount the works of the old clock is
mortised into the base. Another
standard, P, of the same height as O,
is also mortised into the base to provide
a bearing for the end of the shaft
which carries the wood disk Q, the opposite
end of the shaft being connected
by means of a ferrule and soldered to
the end of the minute-hand shaft. The
shaft should be well lined up, so that it
will turn freely. The wood disk is 1/4&nbsp;in. thick and about 6&nbsp;in. in diameter.

  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Pins are Accurately Set in Four Circular Lines
and on Radial Lines (Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
Mark four circles on the face of the
disk, near the outside edge and 1/4&nbsp;in.
apart. Step off the outside circle into
150 parts and draw a radial line from
each mark across the four circular lines
with the straight edge on the center of
the disk. An arc of the disk is shown
in Fig.&nbsp;3, where trip pins are driven in
for making the electric contacts. This
part of the arc shows the method of
locating the pins for the hour from 3
to 4 o'clock, with the intermediate pins
for the quarter, half, and three-quarter-hour
contacts. The intermediate pins
are arranged in the same manner for all
hours, but the hour pins, on the second
circle, run from 1 pin to 12 pins consecutively.
Ordinary pins, with the
heads cut off, are used and should be
driven in accurately on the division
lines to secure proper results.
</p>

<p>
The arrangement of the springs is
shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. These springs, when
pressed together, will close the circuit
for ringing the gongs. They are made
of thin sheet brass, bent as shown at R,
and fastened to a piece, or block, of
hard wood with screws, as shown at
S. The springs numbered 3, 5, 7, and
9 are the ones made as shown at R for
sliding over the pins in the disk Q, and
their ends should clear the face of the
disk about 1/8&nbsp;in. The springs 1, 2, 4,
6, and 8 are about 1/2&nbsp;in. shorter and
have their ends bent up at right angles
so that they will almost touch the long
ones. The spring 1 should be a little
shorter than 2. When fastening the
springs to the block of wood, be sure
that no two springs touch and that
each one is separated from the other
to form no contact until the pins in the
wheel force them together. The block
is then fastened to the base under and
parallel with the shaft carrying the
disk Q, as shown.
</p>

<p>
The starting and stopping of the
clockwork F is accomplished by means
of a set of bell magnets, arranged, as
shown at T, Fig.&nbsp;2, with the wire attached
to the armature bent to touch
the brass wing of the fan G. The armature
must not vibrate, but stay against
the magnet cores while the current
is flowing through them, thus allowing
the clock wheels to turn, and as
soon as the current is cut off, the armature
will spring back and stop the wheels.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Arrange four gongs, U, V, W, and
X, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2, and also three
bell magnets with clappers 1, 2 and 3.
These gongs should be selected for
tone as in a chime clock. The connections
to the bell magnets 1, 2, and 3
should be direct to the binding posts
so that the armature will not vibrate,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_334' name='Page_334' href='#Page_334'>[334]</a></span>
but give one stroke. For instance, bell
magnet 1 should produce one stroke
on the gong U when the current is on,
and one stroke on the gong V when
the current breaks. The magnets 2
should cause the clapper to strike once
on the gong V when the current is
on, and to make one stroke on the gong
W when the current is broken. The
magnets 3 produce only one stroke
on the gong X at a time, which is used
to sound the hours.

the clock, Fig.&nbsp;1, and the bell-ringing
part, Fig.&nbsp;2, are connected
from C to C, D to D, and E, Fig.&nbsp;1, to
the zinc of a battery and from the carbon
to E, Fig.&nbsp;2. Two dry cells will
be sufficient for the current.

  <p>The Wiring Diagram for the Location of the Wires
on the Under Side of the Base (Fig.&nbsp;5)</p>
</div>

<p>
The working of the mechanism is as
follows: Suppose the time is 6 minutes
of 3 o'clock and the contact spring
on the back is near the 11 pin. As
soon as it touches the pin, the armature
K of the switch will be drawn
in contact with the spring N, then
when the contact spring touches the
12 pin, the current will flow into the
magnets T and release the wheels of
the clockwork F, which turns the disk
Q, and the three pins in the second row
will pass over the spring 5 and press it
in contact with the spring 4 three
times, causing the gong X to toll out
3 o'clock. As the contact spring B will
be on the contact pin 12 for about 1
minute, the wheels of the clockwork
F would continue to turn and the bells
ring, if it were not for the stop pin located
on the outside, or first, circle of
the disk Q, which pin is set in line with
the last pin in the set of pins for the
hour, or, in this instance, in line with
the third pin. When the stop pin has
passed the spring, the connection

Hinges Used to Substitute Night Bolt
</h2>


<p>
One of the safest devices for bolting,
or locking, a door against intruders is
to use two sets of hinges. The extra
set is fastened to the door and frame in
the same way but directly opposite the
regular hinges. It may be necessary to
file the extra hinges and pins in order
to separate and bring the parts together
easily. The usual door lock need not
be used with this arrangement, as the
hinges are exposed only on the inside
of the room and cannot be tampered
with from without.

Propellers for a Hand Sled
</h2>


<p>
Desiring to propel my hand sled
with power transmitted by cranks and
wheels, I set about to procure the necessary
materials. Two medium-sized
buggy wheels were found in the back
yard of a blacksmith shop, which were
procured for a nominal price. The
fellies of these wheels were removed,
the tenons cut from the spokes and
nails substituted, which were driven
in their ends so that about 1/2&nbsp;in. of
the body with the head projected.
The heads were then removed and the
nail ends sharpened.
</p>

<p>
The hubs were plugged with pieces
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_335' name='Page_335' href='#Page_335'>[335]</a></span>
of wood, whittled to tightly fit the
holes. A hole was then bored exactly
central through each plug for a 1/2-in.
rod. This size rod was procured and
bent to form a crank, the bearing end
being threaded for a distance equal to
the length of the hub.

<p>
Two pieces or blocks of wood, 2&nbsp;in.
square and 4&nbsp;in. long, were used as
bearings. These were bored centrally
through the long way, to receive
the 1/2-in. rod just loose enough to
make a good bearing. These bearings
were supported by a pair of braces
made of strap iron, about 1/4&nbsp;in. thick
and 3/4&nbsp;in. wide. The length of the
iron will depend on the size of the
wheels and the height of the sled runner.
The braces were shaped as
shown. The center of the bearing hole
must be as high from the surface of
the ground as the distance the spoke
ends are from the center of the hub hole.
</p>

<p>
The crank is then run through the
bearing hole and a nut run on the
threads and a washer placed against
the nut. The wheel is then slipped
on the axle, and another washer and
nut run on tightly. Both wheels,
bearings, cranks, and brackets are
made alike. The brackets are fastened
with small bolts to the sled top.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
The Construction of a Simple Wireless Telephone Set<br />
By A. E. Andrews
</h2>
<h3>In Two Parts&mdash;Part I</h3>


<p>
Among the various methods for the
transmission of speech electrically,
without wire, from one point to another,
the so-called "inductivity" system,
which utilizes the principles of
electromagnetic induction, is perhaps
the simplest, because it requires no special
apparatus. Since this system is
so simple in construction, and its operation
can be easily understood by one
whose knowledge of electricity is limited,
a description will be given of how
to construct and connect the necessary
apparatus required at a station for both
transmitting and receiving a message.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img337'>
  <img src='images/img337.png'

  <p>Fig.&nbsp;1&mdash;Wire Connected to Galvanometer</p>
</div>

<p>
Before taking up the actual construction
and proper connection of the various
pieces of apparatus, it will be well
to explain the electrical operation of the
system. If a conductor be moved in
a magnetic field in any direction other
than parallel to the field, there will be
an electrical pressure induced in the
conductor, and this induced electrical
pressure will produce a current in an
electrical circuit of which the conductor
is a part, provided the circuit be complete,
or closed, just as the electrical
pressure produced in the battery due
to the chemical action in the battery
will produce a current in a circuit connected
to the terminals of the battery.
A simple experiment to illustrate the
fact that there is an induced electrical
pressure set up in a conductor when
it is moved in a magnetic field may be
performed as follows: Take a wire,
AB, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1, and connect its
terminals to a galvanometer, G, as
shown. If no galvanometer can be obtained,
a simple one can be made by
supporting a small compass needle inside
a coil composed of about 100 turns
of small wire. The terminals of the
winding on the coil of the galvanometer
should be connected to the terminals
of the conductor AB, as shown in Fig.
1. If now the conductor AB be moved
up and down past the end of the magnet
N, there will be an electrical pressure
induced in the conductor, and this
electrical pressure will produce a current
in the winding of the galvanometer
G, which will cause the magnetic needle
suspended in the center of the coil to
be acted upon by a magnetic force tending
to move it from its initial position,
or position of rest. It will be found
that this induced electrical pressure will
exist only as long as the conductor AB
is moving with respect to the magnetic
field of the magnet N, as there will
be no deflection of the galvanometer
needle when the motion of the conductor
ceases, indicating there is no
current in the galvanometer winding,
and hence no induced electrical pressure.
It will also be found that the
direction in which the magnetic needle
of the galvanometer is deflected
changes as the direction of motion of
the conductor changes with respect to
the magnet, indicating that there is a
change in the direction of the current
in the winding of the galvanometer,
and since the direction of this
current is dependent upon the direction
in which the induced electrical pressure
acts, there must have been a
change in the direction of this pressure
due to a change in the direction of motion
of the conductor. The same results
can be obtained by moving the
magnet, allowing the conductor AB to
remain stationary, the only requirement
being a relative movement of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_338' name='Page_338' href='#Page_338'>[338]</a></span>
conductor and the magnetic field
created by the magnet.

  <p>Fig.&nbsp;2&mdash;Compass Needle Test</p>
</div>

<p>
It is not necessary that the magnetic
field be created by a permanent magnet.
It can be produced by a current
in a conductor. The fact that there is
a magnetic field surrounding a conductor
in which there is a current can
be shown by a simple
experiment, as
illustrated in Fig.
2. If a wire be
placed above a
compass needle
and parallel to the
direction of the
compass needle and
a current be sent
through the wire in
the direction indicated
by the arrow
I, there will be a
force acting on the
compass needle
tending to turn the
needle at right angles to the wire. The
amount the needle is turned will depend
upon the value of the current in
the wire. There is a definite relation
between the direction of the current in
the wire and the direction of the magnetic
field surrounding the wire, because
a reversal of current in the conductor
will result in a reversal in the
direction in which the compass needle
is deflected. Remembering that the
direction of a magnetic field can be determined
by placing a magnetic needle
in the field and noting the direction in
which the N-pole of the needle points,
this being taken as the positive direction,
if one looks along a conductor in
which there is a current and the current
be from the observer, the direction
of the magnetic field about the conductor
will be clockwise. Imagine a
conductor carrying a current and that
you are looking at a cross-section of
this conductor (see Fig.&nbsp;3), and the direction
of the current in the conductor
is from you (this being indicated in
the figure by the cross inside the circle),
then the lines of force of the magnetic
field will be concentric circles
about the conductor, they being nearer
together near the conductor, indicating
the strength of the field is greatest
near the conductor. A compass
needle placed above the conductor
would place itself in such a position
that the N-pole would point toward
the right and the S-pole toward the left.
If the needle be placed below the conductor,
the N-pole would point to the
left and the S-pole to the right, indicating
that the direction of the magnetic
field above the conductor is just the reverse
of what it is below the conductor.

  />
  <p>Fig.&nbsp;4&mdash;Reversed Lines of Force</p>
</div>

<p>
The strength of the magnetic field
produced by a current in a conductor
can be greatly increased by forming
the conductor into a coil. Figure 4
shows the cross-section of a coil composed
of a single turn of wire. The
current in the upper cross-section is
just the reverse of what it is in the
lower cross-section, as indicated by the
cross and dash inside the two circles.
As a result of the direction of current
in the two cross-sections being different,
the direction of the magnetic field
about these two cross-sections will be
different, one being clockwise, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_339' name='Page_339' href='#Page_339'>[339]</a></span>
other counter-clockwise. It will be observed,
however, that all the lines of
force pass through the center of the
coil in the same direction, or the magnetic
field inside the coil is due to the
combined action of the various parts
of the conductor forming the complete
turn. This magnetic field can be increased
in value, without increasing
the current in the conductor, by adding
more turns to the coil.

  />
  <p>Fig.&nbsp;5&mdash;Magnetic Lines Passing through Center</p>
</div>

<p>
A cross-section through a coil composed
of eight turns placed side by
side is shown in Fig.&nbsp;5. The greater
part of the magnetic lines created by
each turn pass through the remaining
turns as shown in the figure, instead
of passing around the conductor in
which the current exists that creates
them. This results in the total number
of lines passing through the coil
per unit of cross-sectional area being
greater than it was for a single turn,
although the value of the current in
the conductor has remained constant,
the only change being an increase in
the number of turns forming the coil.
</p>

<p>
If a conductor be moved by the end
of a coil similar to that shown in Fig.
5, when there is a current in the winding
of the coil, there will be an electrical
pressure induced in the conductor,
just the same as though it were
moved by the end of a permanent magnet.
The polarity of the coil is marked
in Fig.&nbsp;5. The magnetic lines pass
from the S-pole to the N-pole through
the coil and from the N-pole to the S-pole
outside the coil, just as they do
in a permanent magnet.

<p>
A tenon placed in a blind mortise
can be permanently fastened, when
putting the joints together, by two
wedges driven in the end grain of the
wood. In some cases, where the wood
to be used is very dry and brittle, it is
advisable to dip the tenon in warm
water before applying the glue. The
glue must be applied immediately after
the tenon is removed from the water,
and then inserted in the mortise. The
sketch shows the application of the
wedges. The bottom of the mortise
drives the wedges as the tenon is
forced in place.

Procure a large water bottle and
have a glass cutter cut the top off so

about 8-1/2&nbsp;in.
high. Next obtain
two pieces
of carbon, about
8&nbsp;in. long, 4&nbsp;in.
wide and 1/4&nbsp;in.
thick. Melt up
some old scrap
zinc and mold a
piece having
the same dimensions
as the
pieces of carbon.
The mold
for casting the
zinc may be
made by nailing
some 1/4-in. strips of wood on a
piece of dry board, forming a shallow
box, 4&nbsp;in. wide and 8&nbsp;in. long. Remove
all the impurities from the surface
of the zinc when it is melted,
with a metal spoon or piece of tin.
Before filling the mold with the metal,
place a piece of No. 14 gauge bare
copper wire through a small hole in
one of the end pieces forming the
mold, and allow it to project several
inches inside, and make sure the mold
is perfectly level. The zinc will run
around the end of the wire, which is to
afford a means of connecting the zinc
plate to one of the binding posts forming
the terminals of the cell.
</p>

<p>
Cut from some hard wood four
pieces a little longer than the outside
diameter of the glass jar, two of them
1/2 by 1/2&nbsp;in., and two, 1/2 by 5/8&nbsp;in. Drill
a 1/8-in. hole in each end of all four
pieces, the holes being perpendicular
to the 1/2-in. dimension in each case,
and about 3/8&nbsp;in. from the end. Boil
all the pieces for several minutes in
paraffin and stand them up on end
to drain. Procure two 1/8-in. brass
bolts, 3-1/2&nbsp;in. long, which are to be
used in clamping the elements of the
cell together. The two smaller pieces
of wood should be placed on each side
of one end of the zinc, then the carbon
pieces and the larger pieces of wood
outside the carbon pieces. The carbon
plates should be connected together
and then connected to a binding post
which forms the positive terminal of
the cell. If unable to obtain pieces of
carbon of the required dimensions, a
number of ordinary electric-light carbons
may be used. Get about ten
1/2-in. carbons, without the copper coating,
if possible; if not, file all the copper
off. Cut these carbons off, forming
8-in. lengths. File the top ends of the
carbons flat and so that they all become
equal in thickness, and clamp
them in place by means of the brass
bolts. If rods are used, they should all
be connected together by means of a
piece of copper wire and then to a
binding post.
</p>

<p>
The plates may now be hung in the
jar, the wooden pieces resting on the
top of the jar and acting as a support.
The solution for this cell is made by
dissolving 1/2&nbsp;lb. of potassium bichromate
in 1/2 gal. of water, and then
adding very slowly 1/2&nbsp;lb. of strong
sulphuric acid. More or less solution
may be made by using the proper proportion
of each ingredient.
</p>

<p>
This cell will have a voltage of two
volts, a rather low internal resistance,
and will be capable of delivering a
large current. If it should begin to
show signs of exhaustion, a little more
acid may be added.
</p>

<p>
A chemical action goes on in this
cell regardless of whether it supplies
current to an external circuit or not,
and for this reason the elements should
be removed from the solution and
hung directly over the jar when the
cell is not in use. A simple device for
this purpose may be constructed as
shown. A cord may be passed through
the opening in the crossbar at the top
and its lower end attached to the elements.
When the elements are drawn
out of the solution, the upper end of
the cord may be fastened in some manner.
This frame can, of course, be
made longer, so it will accommodate
a number of cells.

<h2>
The Construction of a Simple Wireless Telephone Set<br />
By A. E. Andrews
</h2>
<h3>In Two Parts&mdash;Part II</h3>


<p>
If two coils of wire be placed parallel
to each other as shown in Fig.&nbsp;6, and a
current be passed through the winding
of one of them, say A, a part of the
magnetic lines of force created by this
current will pass through the other coil
B. These lines of magnetic force must
cut across the turns of wire of the
coil in which there is no current as the
magnetic field is being created, and as
a result there will be an electrical pressure
produced in the winding of the
coil carrying no current. When the current
in coil A is discontinued, the magnetic
field created by this current is
destroyed or it contracts to zero, and
the magnetic lines again cut the various
turns composing the winding of
coil B. The direction in which the
magnetic lines of force and the winding
of coil B move with respect to
each other is just the reverse, when the
current in the winding of coil A is increasing,
to what it is when the current
in the winding of the coil A is decreasing.
Any change in the value of
the current in the winding of coil A
will result in a change in the number
of magnetic lines of force linked with
the winding of the coil B, and as a result
of this change in the number of
lines linked with the winding of coil
B there will be an induced electrical
pressure set up in coil B. The direction
of this induced electrical pressure will
depend upon whether the current in
the winding of coil A is increasing or
decreasing in value. When the current
in the winding of coil A is increasing
in value, the electrical pressure induced
in the winding of coil B will be in such
a direction that the current produced
by this induced electrical pressure will
pass around the winding of coil B in
the opposite direction to that in which
the current passes around the winding
of coil A. Or the current produced by
the induced electrical pressure tends to
produce a magnetic field opposite in
direction to the one created by the current
in the winding of coil A. When
the current in the winding of A is decreasing
in value, the induced pressure
in the winding of the coil B is just the
reverse of what it was in the previous
case and the current produced by this
induced
pressure
passes
around the
winding of
the coil B in
the same direction
as
the current
passes
around the
winding of
coil A. The
current produced
by the
induced electrical pressure aids the current
in the winding of coil A in producing
a magnetic field. In general the
current resulting from the induced
pressure always passes around the circuit
in such a direction as to produce
a magnetic effect which will oppose a
change in the value of the magnetic
field causing the induced electrical
pressure.

coil B remains in the magnetic field of
the coil A and its plane is not parallel
to magnetic lines; or, in other
words, coil B must always be in such
a position that some of the magnetic
lines created by the current in coil A
will pass through the winding of coil B.
</p>

<p>
If a telephone transmitter and a battery
be connected in series with the
winding of coil A, a fluctuating or varying
current can be made to pass
through the winding by causing the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_342' name='Page_342' href='#Page_342'>[342]</a></span>
diaphragm of the transmitter to vibrate
by speaking into the mouthpiece of the
transmitter. This varying current will
set up a varying magnetic field and
there will be an induced electrical pressure
set up in coil B, if it be properly
placed with respect to coil A. A receiver
connected in series with the
winding of coil B will be subjected to
the action of a varying current due to
the induced electrical pressure in the
winding of coil B and as a result, the
diaphragm of the receiver will vibrate
in unison with that of the transmitter,
and speech can thus be transmitted.
The connection just described should
be somewhat modified and a little more
equipment used in order to give the
best results.

  <p>Fig.&nbsp;7&mdash;Sending and Receiving Equipment</p>
</div>

<p>
Figure 7 shows the complete sending
and receiving equipment, a complete
outfit of this kind being required
for each station. The transmitter
T and the receiver R may be
an ordinary local battery transmitter
and receiver, although a high-resistance
receiver will give better results.
The induction coil with the windings,
marked P and S, may be any commercial
type of induction coil as used in a
magneto telephone instrument, but a
coil with a high-wound secondary will
give better results. The push button
K is to be used in closing the transmitter
circuit when the set is being
used for transmitting, the key being depressed,
and for shorting out the high
resistance secondary winding when the
set is used in receiving, the key being
in the normal position. Ten dry cells
should be connected in series and used
to supply current to the transmitter
circuit, as shown by B in the figure.
The receiver R, secondary winding of
the induction coil S, and the winding
of coil A used in transmitting and receiving
the magnetic effects, are all
connected in series. The winding of
the coil A consists of two parts, D and
E, as shown in the figure, with two of
their ends connected together by means
of a condenser, C, having a capacity
of about 2 micro-farads. Each of these
parts should consist of about 200 turns
of No. 22 gauge silk-covered copper
wire, wound on an ordinary bicycle rim.
The inside end of one winding should
be connected to the outside of the other
by means of the condenser, the two
coils being wound in the same direction.
The condenser C can be procured
at a small cost from almost any
telephone company.
</p>

<p>
To talk, two of the instruments are
placed 25 or 30&nbsp;ft. apart, and they may
be placed in different rooms as walls
and other ordinary obstructions that
do not interfere with the production of
the magnetic field about the transmitting
coil, have no effect upon the
operation. Pressing the button K at
the transmitting station, closes the
transmitter circuit and removes the
shunt from about the secondary winding
of the induction. Any vibration of
the transmitter will cause a varying
current to pass through the primary
winding P, which in turn induces an
electrical pressure in the secondary
winding S, and this pressure causes a
varying current to pass through the
coil A. The varying current in the
winding of the coil A produces a varying
magnetic field which acts upon the
receiving coil, inducing an electrical
pressure in it and producing a current
through the receiver at the receiving station.
</p>

<p>
A filing coherer, adapted to close a
local relay circuit and ring an ordinary
bell, may be used with the sets just described
for signaling between stations.

<h2>
An Electric Incubator
</h2>


<p>
Where electric current is available,
it can be used to heat an incubator
much better and cleanlier than the
kerosene lamp. The materials are inexpensive
and the cost should be no
more than for the ordinary kind of heater.
</p>

<p>
First of all the box part must be
made of very dry wood, 1/2&nbsp;in. thick.
The material should be matched, as
the cost of the operation depends upon
the construction of the box. The
proper size for an 80-egg incubator is
2&nbsp;ft. square and 1&nbsp;ft. high. If a larger
one is desired, the dimensions may be
varied to suit, but it is not necessary
to make it any higher for a larger one.
If it is desired to have a window in the
door, care must be taken to make it a
good fit. The top, as shown in the
sketch, is made without hinges so that
it can be readily set on and removed.
This makes it handy in case of repairing
the heater and cleaning the box.
The inside of the box, with the exception
of the bottom, should be covered
with asbestos paper.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img343b'>

  </a>
  <p>Fig.&nbsp;1&mdash;Box Details</p>
</div>

<p>
After the box is finished, fit it with
a tray, 1-1/2&nbsp;ft. by 1&nbsp;ft. 10-3/4&nbsp;in. A
tray having these dimensions will slide
easily in the box. This is an essential
feature of the hatching. The frame of
the tray D, Fig.&nbsp;1, consists of wood,
3/4 by 3/4&nbsp;in., with a bottom made of
wire mesh. The mesh should be firmly
attached, so that it will not give away
when full of eggs. Runners for the
tray are placed 4-1/2&nbsp;in. from the bottom
of the box. When the tray is put in
place, it will not touch the back. This
small space is left for the chicks to
fall into the nursery below. About
4&nbsp;in. below the tray four holes are
bored, AA, 1/8&nbsp;in. in diameter, one on
each side of the box. These holes admit
fresh air to the eggs.

  <p>Fig.&nbsp;2&mdash;Heater Details</p>
</div>

<p>
The electric heater is just large
enough to allow a space about 1/2&nbsp;in.
on all edges. This makes it 23&nbsp;in.
square. A piece of 1/4-in. asbestos of
the above size should be secured, on
which to place the heating wire. The
amount of wire depends on the size
and kind. As it is not necessary to
heat the wire very hot, iron or steel
wire may be used. The length of wire
may be determined by the following method:
</p>

<p>
Wind the wire on a long stick, making
sure that no one coil touches its
neighbor. Connect one wire of the current
supply at one end of the coil and
run the other end of the current
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_344' name='Page_344' href='#Page_344'>[344]</a></span>
supply along the coils, starting at the extreme
opposite end and drawing toward
the center until the iron wire gets too
hot to hold with the bare hand. This
will be the right length of wire to use.
The length being known, a number of
tacks are placed in the asbestos board
to hold the wire, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2.
Cover the wire with a sheet of asbestos
and attach binding-posts, E and F, at
each end.
</p>

<p>
The asbestos inclosing the heating
wires is covered with a thin piece of
sheet iron, which is made to fit tightly
over the bottom and sides. This will
spread the heat evenly. Be careful to
have the binding-posts insulated from
the sheet metal. In the cross section
of the heater, Fig.&nbsp;2, A represents the
1/4-in. asbestos board; B, the heater
wire; C, the asbestos paper, and D the
sheet-metal covering.
</p>

<p>
The most important part of the incubator
is the thermostat which regulates
the current to maintain a steady
heat. It is not advisable to make this
instrument, as a good one can be purchased
for less than $1. Place the
thermostat in the end of the box at
B, Fig.&nbsp;1. A small door, E, is made in
the box for easy adjustment of the thumbscrews.
</p>

<p>
Suspend the heater from the cover
of the box with bolts 2-3/4&nbsp;in. long, as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. A base receptacle, G,
and a snap switch, H, are fastened on
top of the cover and connected up to
the thermostat B, the condenser C, the
heater F, and lamp I, as shown. Another
snap switch, J, is used on the
light only. The condenser C is to prevent
sparking, thus saving the platinum
points on the screws. Do not use
more than a 2-cp. lamp for lighting
purposes, as a brighter light blinds the
young chicks.
</p>

<p>
The incubator should be run for a
day or two so that the current may be
well regulated before placing the eggs
in the tray. The incubator is operated
the same as with lamp heat.&mdash;Contributed

Temperature Alarm

<p>
The falling temperature of a room
during the night may result in a very
bad cold for the occupant. This may
be prevented by the use of an alarm
to awaken the sleeper and warn him
to close the window. An alarm can
be made as follows: Take a glass
tube about 4&nbsp;in. long and 1/4&nbsp;in. in diameter
and close one end, used for the
bottom, with sealing wax, in which
the bare end of a No. 20 gauge magnet
wire is inserted. The tube is almost
filled with mercury. On the mercury
a float of wax is placed in which
a bare piece of the same magnet
wire is inserted and bent as shown
in the sketch. The tube of mercury is
fastened to a base with two clips of
metal. At the upper end of this base
the adjustable lever A is attached.
The electric connections are made as
shown in the sketch.

Stereoscopic Pictures with an Ordinary Camera
</h2>


<p>
Make a small table as wide as the
camera is long and 3&nbsp;in. longer than
the camera is wide. Sink a screw nut
in the center of the under side to engage
the regular tripod screw. Fasten
a double or two-way spirit level
on the front left-hand corner. Nail
strips on both ends and on the rear
side, to form a shallow box with three
sides. The illustration shows the construction
quite plainly. This device
was used by a correspondent of Camera
Craft as follows: The table was
fastened to the tripod and carefully
leveled. The camera is placed at one
side, bringing the back snugly into the
corner on that side. Make the exposure,
change the film, slide the camera
over to the other side and make another
exposure. The table being 3&nbsp;in.
longer than the camera is wide, the lens
will be moved exactly 3&nbsp;in. when the
camera is moved over to the other
side. Three inches is the separation of
the lenses in stereoscopic cameras and
the negatives made as above will be
the same.

  <p>Table on Tripod for Camera</p>
</div>

<p>
As the negatives must be sized, it
is necessary to use films. A camera
using films 3-1/2 by 3-1/2&nbsp;in. will make
negatives that can be trimmed 1/4&nbsp;in.
on each side to make prints 3 by 3-1/4&nbsp;in. Each two negatives making a pair
are fastened together, properly transposed,
by folding a narrow strip of
black paper like a long, V-shaped
trough, pasting it, and putting one on
the bottom of the two negatives, as
they lie side by side, and one at the top;
saddle fashion. This can be done still
easier by using strips of passe-partout
binding, or strips used for binding lantern
slides. If so desired, the use of
black paper can be carried farther by
cutting the top strip of binding paper
in such a way that it gives the round
corners to the top of the prints. A
narrow strip through the center and a
binding of black paper along the two
end edges make a mask unnecessary in printing.

<h2>
Construction of a Small Bell-Ringing Transformer<br />
By A. E. Andrews
</h2>


<h3>
Part I&mdash;Fundamental Principles
</h3>

<p>
The transformer in its simplest form
consists of two separate and electrically
independent coils of wire, usually
wound upon an iron core.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img348a'>
  <img src='images/img348a.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Fig.&nbsp;1&mdash;Two Coils on an Iron Ring</p>
</div>

<p>
Figure 1 shows two coils, P and S,
placed upon an iron ring, R. One of
these coils is connected to some source
of energy, such as an alternating-current
generator, or an alternating-current
lighting circuit, receiving its
energy therefrom. The other coil is
connected to a load to which it delivers
alternating current. The coil of the
transformer that is connected to the
source of energy is called the primary
coil, and the one that is connected to
the load, the secondary coil.
</p>

<p>
The electrical pressure (voltage) at
which current is supplied by the secondary
bears a definite relation to the
electrical pressure at which current is
supplied to the primary. This relation,
as will be explained later, is practically
the same as the relation between the
number of turns in the secondary and
primary coils. If there are a smaller
number of turns in the secondary coil
than there are in the primary, the secondary
voltage is less than the primary,
and the transformer is called a step-down
transformer. If, on the other
hand, there are a larger number of secondary
turns than of primary, the secondary
voltage is greater than the
primary voltage, and the transformer
is called a step-up transformer.
</p>

<p>
The transfer of electrical energy
from the primary coil to the secondary
coil of a transformer is based upon the
fundamental principles of electromagnetism
and electromagnetic induction,
and it will be necessary to
investigate these principles before we
can understand the operation of the transformer.
</p>

<p>
A magnet is a body, which, when
freely suspended, assumes approximately
a north and south position. The
end of the magnet that points north is
called the north pole, while the end
that points south is called the south
pole. The region surrounding a magnet
is called a magnetic field. In this
field the magnetism is supposed to flow
along a large number of imaginary
lines, called lines of force, and these
lines are all supposed to emanate from
the north pole of the magnet, pass
through the medium surrounding the
magnet and enter the south pole. The
magnetic field surrounding a bar magnet
is shown in Fig.&nbsp;2. The strength
of any magnetic field depends upon
the number of these lines of force per
unit area (square centimeter), the area
being taken perpendicular to the direction
of the lines.

  <p>Fig.&nbsp;2&mdash;Magnetic Field</p>
</div>

<p>
In 1812, Oersted discovered that a
compass needle, which is nothing but
a permanent magnet freely suspended
or supported, when placed near a conductor
in which there was a direct
current, was acted upon by a force that
tended to bring the needle into a position
at right angles to the conductor.
This simple experiment proved to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_349' name='Page_349' href='#Page_349'>[349]</a></span>
Oersted that there was a magnetic field
produced by the current in the conductor.
He also found that there was a
definite relation between the direction
of the current in the conductor, and
the direction in which the north pole
of the compass needle pointed. If the
compass needle is allowed to come to
rest in the earth's magnetic field, and
a conductor is placed above it, the
conductor being parallel to the needle,
and a current then sent through the
conductor, the needle will be deflected
from its position of rest. Reversing
the current in the conductor, reverses
the direction in which the needle is
deflected. If the needle be allowed to
come to rest while there is a current
in the conductor, and this current is
then increased, it will be found that
the deflection of the needle will be increased,
but not in direct proportion to
the increase in the current. Hence
the strength of this magnetic field surrounding
the conductor depends upon
the value of the current in the conductor,
and the direction of the field depends
upon the direction of the current.

<p>
If a conductor be passed through a
piece of cardboard, as shown in Fig.
3, and a current sent through it in the
direction indicated by the arrow A, a
compass needle, moved about the conductor
in the path indicated by the
dotted line, will always assume such a
position that the north pole points
around the conductor in a clockwise
direction as you look down on the cardboard.
If the current be reversed, the
direction assumed by the compass
needle will be reversed. Looking
along a conductor in the direction of
the current, the magnetic field will
consist of magnetic lines encircling the
conductor. These lines will be concentric
circles, as a general rule, except
when they are distorted by the
presence of other magnets or magnetic
materials, and their direction will be clockwise.

The strength of the magnetic field
at any point near this conductor will
depend upon the value of the current
in the conductor, and the distance the
point is from the conductor. The
magnetic field surrounding a conductor
is shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. The plus sign indicates
that the direction of the current
is from you. The strength of a
magnetic field due to a current in a
conductor can be greatly increased by
forming a coil of the conductor. Each
turn of the coil then produces a certain
number of lines, and the greater part
of these lines pass through the center
of the coil, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;5. The
field strength inside such a coil is dependent
upon the number of turns in
the coil, and the value of the current
in these turns. Increasing the number
of turns in the coil increases the number
of magnetic lines passing through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_350' name='Page_350' href='#Page_350'>[350]</a></span>
the center of the coil, as shown in Fig.
6. If the current be decreased in value,
the field strength is decreased, and if
the current be reversed in direction,
the magnetic field is reversed in direction.
The number of magnetic lines
passing through the solenoid depends
also upon the kind of material composing
the core of the solenoid, in addition
to the number of turns and the value of
the current in these turns. The number
of lines per unit area inside a solenoid
with an air core can be multiplied
several times by introducing a soft-iron
core. If this core be extended as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;7, the magnetic circuit
(the path through which the magnetic
lines pass) may be completed through
it. The larger part of the total number
of lines will pass through the iron,
as it is a much better conductor of
magnetism than air.

<p>
In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered
that there was an electrical pressure
induced in an electrical conductor
when it was moved in a magnetic field
so that it cut some of the lines forming
the field. If this conductor be made
to form part of a closed electrical circuit,
there will be a current produced
in the circuit as a result of the induceds
electrical pressure. The value of
this induced electrical pressure depends
upon the number of magnetic lines of
force that the conductor cuts in one
second. If 100,000,000 lines are cut in
one second, an electrical pressure of
one volt is produced. The direction of
the induced pressure depends upon the
direction of the movement of the conductor
and the direction of the lines
of force in the magnetic field; reversing
either the direction of the magnetic
field or the motion of the conductor,
reverses the direction of the induced
pressure. If both the direction of the
magnetic field, and the direction of the
motion of the conductor be reversed,
there is no change in the direction of
the induced pressure, for there is then
no change in the relative directions of
the two. The same results can be obtained
by moving the magnetic field
with respect to the conductor in such
a way that the lines of force of the
field cut the conductor.

  <p>Fig.8&mdash;Two Coils about a Magnetic Circuit through Iron</p>
</div>

<p>
If a permanent magnet be thrust
into a coil of wire, there will be an
electrical pressure set up in the coil
so long as the turns of wire forming
the coil are cutting the lines of force
that are produced by the magnet.
When the magnet is withdrawn, the
induced electrical pressure will be reversed
in direction, since the direction
of cutting is reversed. A magnetic
field may be produced through a
coil of wire by winding it on the magnetic
circuit shown in Fig.&nbsp;8. Now
any change of current in the coil P will
cause a change in the number of magnetic
lines passing through S and
hence there will be an induced electrical
pressure set up in S so long as the
number of lines passing through it is
changing. The pressure induced in
each of the turns comprising the coil
S depends upon the change in the number
of magnetic lines through it.
</p>

<p>
Let us now consider a condition of
operation when there is no current in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_351' name='Page_351' href='#Page_351'>[351]</a></span>
the secondary coil and the primary coil
is connected to some source of electrical
energy. When this is the case the
current in the primary coil is not determined
by Ohm's law, which states
that the current is equal to the electrical
pressure divided by the resistance,
but is considerably less in value,
for the following reason. The magnetic
lines of force produced by the
current in the primary induces an electrical
pressure in the primary winding
itself, the direction of which is always
opposite to the impressed pressure, or
the one producing the current. As a
result of this induced pressure being
set up in the primary, the effective
pressure acting in the circuit
is decreased. At the same time there
is an electrical pressure induced in the
secondary winding in the same direction
as that induced in the primary.
</p>

<p>
If the secondary circuit be connected
to a load, there will be a current in the
secondary winding, which will pass
around the magnetic circuit in the opposite
direction to the primary current,
and as a result will decrease the number
of lines passing through the primary
coil. This will in turn decrease
the electrical pressure induced in the
primary coil, and a larger current will
exist in the primary winding than there
was before any current was taken from
the secondary coil. The decrease in
induced pressure is small, but it is always
ample to allow the required increase
in primary current. There is,
at the same time, a small decrease in
the secondary pressure.
</p>

<p>
When the transformer is operating
on no load, with no current in the secondary
coil, the induced pressure in the
primary coil is practically equal to the
impressed pressure and hence a very
small current will be taken from the
source of energy. It is apparent now
that if the primary and secondary coils
have the same number of turns, the induced
electrical pressure in each of
these coils will be the same, assuming,
of course, that all the magnetic lines
that pass through the primary also
pass through the secondary coil, and
vice versa, or the secondary pressure is
practically the same as the pressure
impressed on the primary. If the
number of turns in the secondary coil
is greater or less than the number of
turns in the primary, the magnetic
lines will be cut a greater or less number
of times by the secondary coil, and
hence the induced pressure will be
greater or less, depending upon the relation
of the number of turns in the two coils.

them in a solution of 1&nbsp;oz. hyposulphite
of soda and 8&nbsp;oz. of water, and
wash them thoroughly. While the

saturated solution of bichloride of mercury.
Be very careful to wash the
hands and trays after using the mercury
solution, as it is poisonous. When
the print is placed in the mercury solution,
the picture vanishes completely.
Leave the prints in this bath just long
enough for the image to disappear,
and then wash and dry them thoroughly.
Soak some clean blotting
paper in the hyposulphite-of-soda solution
and allow it to dry. You are now
ready to perform the magic-photograph trick.

<p>
To cause the spirit photograph to

<h2>
Construction of a Small Bell-Ringing Transformer<br />
By A. E. Andrews
</h2>


<h3>
Part II&mdash;Construction
</h3>

<p>
Transformers may be divided into
two main groups, the classification being
made according to the relation
between the magnetic circuit of the
transformer and the primary and secondary
windings. When the two
windings surround the magnetic circuit
of a transformer, as indicated in
Fig.&nbsp;9, the transformer is said to be of
core type. If the magnetic circuit
surrounds the windings, as indicated
in Fig.&nbsp;10, the transformer is said to
be of the shell type. The following instructions
are for a shell-type transformer.
</p>

  <p>Fig.&nbsp;9&mdash;Core-Type Transformer</p>
</div>

<p>
Any mass of magnetic material,
such as a piece of soft iron, when
placed in a magnetic field that is produced
by an alternating current, will
be rapidly magnetized and demagnetized,
the rapidity of the change depending
upon the frequency of the
current producing the field. When a
piece of iron is magnetized and demagnetized,
as just stated, there will
be a certain amount of heat generated
in it and this heat represents energy
that must come from the electrical circuit
producing the magnetic field in
which the iron is placed.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img352b'>
  <img src='images/img352b.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Fig.&nbsp;10&mdash;Shell-Type Transformer</p>
</div>

<p>
The heat that is generated in the
iron is due to two causes: First, the
hysteresis loss which is due to a property
of the iron that causes the magnetism
in the iron to lag behind the
magnetizing influence, or the changes
that are constantly taking place in the
field strength due to the alternating
current. This loss cannot be entirely
eliminated, but it may be reduced to a
very low value by using a soft grade of
iron, or one having what is called a
low hysteretic constant. Second, the
eddy-current loss which is due to the
circulation of currents through the
mass of metal. These currents are
due to unequal electromotive forces set
up in the different parts of the piece
of metal when there is
a change in the
strength of the field in
which the metal is
placed. This loss cannot
be entirely eliminated,
but it can be
greatly reduced by
breaking the mass of
metal up into parts and insulating these
parts from each other, which results
in the paths in which the eddy currents
originally circulated being destroyed to
a certain extent.
</p>

<p>
The breaking up of the metal is
usually made in such a way that the
joints between the various parts are
parallel to the direction of the magnetic
field. When the joints are made
in this way, they offer less opposition
to the magnetizing force. This is one
of the principal reasons why induction-coil
cores are made up of a bundle of
wires instead of a solid piece. These
wires are annealed or softened to reduce
the hysteresis loss that would
occur. The combined hysteresis and
eddy-current losses, which are spoken
of as the iron losses, will of course be
very small in the transformer you are
going to construct, but the above discussion
is given to show why the magnetic
circuits of transformers are built
up from sheets of soft iron, called laminations.
The core is said to be laminated.
</p>

<p>
The dimensions of the complete magnetic
circuit, of the transformer you
are going to construct, are given in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_353' name='Page_353' href='#Page_353'>[353]</a></span>
Fig.&nbsp;11. The primary and secondary
windings are both to be placed about
the center portion C, and it is apparent
that the winding of these coils would
be very tedious if the wire had to be
passed back and forth through the
openings A and B. This procedure in
winding can be prevented by first
forming the part of the magnetic circuit
upon which the windings are
placed; then wind on the coils and,
after they are completed, finish building
up the magnetic circuit with pieces
cut to the proper size and shape.

<p>
Procure a small quantity of soft,
thin sheet iron and cut out a sufficient
number of rectangular pieces, 3&nbsp;in. by
4-1/4&nbsp;in., to make a pile 3/4&nbsp;in. in height
when firmly pressed together. Now
cut a rectangular notch in each of these
pieces, 2&nbsp;in. wide and 3-5/8&nbsp;in. long. The
sides of this notch can be cut with a
pair of tinner's shears, and the end
can be cut with a sharp cold-chisel.
Be careful not to bend either piece
any more than you can help. The outside
piece, or the one in which the
notch is cut, should have dimensions
corresponding to those given in Fig.
12. When all of these pieces have been
cut, as indicated above, the rectangular
pieces, 2&nbsp;in. by 3-5/8&nbsp;in., that were cut
out to form the notch in the larger
pieces, should have two of their corners
cut away, so as to form pieces whose
dimensions correspond to those given
in Fig.&nbsp;13. These last pieces are to
form the core and part of the end of
the transformer. Now make sure that
all the edges of the pieces are perfectly
smooth and that they are all of the
same size; then give each one a coat of
very thin shellac.

<p>
Now cut from a piece of insulating
fiber, that is about 1/16&nbsp;in. thick, two
pieces whose dimensions correspond to
those given in Fig.&nbsp;14. When these
pieces are completed, the core of the
transformer can be assembled as follows:
Place the T-shaped pieces, whose
dimensions correspond to those given
in Fig.&nbsp;13, through the openings in the
pieces of insulation, alternate pieces
being put through the openings from
opposite sides. The distance from outside
to outside of the pieces of insulation
should be exactly the same as the
length of the vertical portion of the T-shaped
pieces forming the core, or 3&nbsp;in.

<p>
Cut from some soft wood four pieces
having cross sections whose dimensions
correspond to those given in Fig.
15, and of such a length that they will
just slip down between the two pieces
of insulation. These pieces should now
be placed on the four sides of the iron
core and covered with several layers of
heavy insulating cloth. Each layer of
the cloth should be shellacked as it is
put on, which will increase the insulation
and at the same time help in holding
the wooden pieces in place. You
are now ready to start winding the transformer.

<p>
The secondary, which is the low-voltage
side in this case, as you are
using the transformer to reduce or step
down the voltage, will have the smaller
number of turns, and larger wire
should be used in winding it than in
the primary, as it will carry a larger
current. On account of the secondary
being of larger wire, it will be placed on
the core first. For this winding you
will need a small quantity of No. 26 B.
&amp; S. gauge, single cotton-covered wire.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_354' name='Page_354' href='#Page_354'>[354]</a></span>
Drill a small hole through one of the
insulating washers, down close to the
cloth covering the core, being careful
at the same time to keep the hole as far
from the metal part of the core as possible.
Pass the end of a short piece of
No. 18 or 20 B. &amp; S. gauge, double
cotton-covered wire through this opening
and solder it to the end of the No.
26 wire. Insulate the joint with a piece
of paraffin paper or cloth, and bind the
piece of heavy wire to the core of the
transformer with a piece of linen thread.
</p>

<p>
Now wind the No. 26 wire on the
core as evenly as possible, to within
about 1/8&nbsp;in. of the end of the spool.
Place over the first layer two layers of
paraffin paper and wind on a second
layer of wire. Three layers should
give you the required number of turns
in the secondary winding and a resistance
of approximately 3-1/2 ohms. The
end of the secondary winding should
be terminated in the same way as the
winding was started. Outside of the
completed secondary winding place at
least six layers of paraffin paper, or
several layers of insulating cloth. The
paraffin paper used should be approximately
five mills in thickness. You
can make your own paraffin paper by
taking a good quality of writing paper
about two mills thick and dipping it
into some hot paraffin, then hanging it
up by one edge to drain.
</p>

<p>
The primary winding is to be made
from No. 34 B. &amp; S. gauge, single silk-covered
copper wire. The inside end
of this winding should be started in
the same way as the secondary, but at
the end opposite to the one where the
secondary terminated. Wind about
240 turns on each layer and place one
layer of paraffin paper between each
layer of wire. The primary winding
should have at least 12 layers, and the
outside end should be terminated as
the inside end. Outside of the completed
windings, place several layers of
insulating cloth to serve as an insulation,
and at the same time provide a
mechanical protection for the windings.

The outside part of the magnetic
circuit can now be put in place. When
the U-shaped pieces are all in place,
the magnetic circuit will have the form
and dimensions shown in Fig.&nbsp;11. A
clamp should now be made for each
end of the transformer, to hold the
pieces forming the magnetic circuit together,
and at the same time give an
easy means of mounting the transformer.
Cut from a piece of sheet
iron, about 1/16&nbsp;in. in thickness, two
pieces whose dimensions correspond to
those given in Fig.&nbsp;16, and two pieces
whose dimensions correspond to those
given in Fig.&nbsp;17. Drill the holes in
these pieces as indicated, and bend the
larger ones into the form shown in Fig.
18. These pieces can now be clamped
across the ends of the transformer with
small bolts, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;19.

that it will be at least 1/8&nbsp;in. from the
transformer at all points. This box
should be provided with a cover that
can be easily removed.

holes in the bottom of the box. Two
binding-posts can now be mounted on
one end of the box, and insulated from
it, to serve as terminals for the secondary
winding. Two pieces of
stranded No. 14 B. &amp; S. gauge, rubber-covered
copper wire should now be
soldered to the terminals of the
primary circuit and passed out through
insulating bushings mounted in holes
cut in the end of the box opposite to
the one upon which the binding-posts
were mounted. These heavy wires
should be firmly fastened to the iron

from the smaller wires. Be sure to

<p>
A reliable letter scale that can be easily
made is shown in the sketch. It
consists of a wide-neck bottle filled
with water into
which the weighing
device is inserted.
This latter part is
made of a light piece
of wood weighted on
the lower end, to
keep it in a stable,
upright position, and
a piece of cardboard
is tacked to the
other. The wood is
placed in the water,
and known weights
are used on the cardboard
while calibrating.
</p>

<p>
The first line is marked at the water
level when there is no weight on the
cardboard, and then a known weight
placed on the top and another mark
made at the water level, and so on, until
a sufficient number of 1/2-oz. and
ounce-divisions have been marked.
The wood should be well coated with
shellac varnish before it is placed in
the water.&mdash;Contributed by Francis

  <p>Wiring Diagrams for a Single Bell (Fig.&nbsp;1, Fig.&nbsp;2, Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
The following diagrams will indicate
a few of the various methods that
may be employed in connecting up
electric bells for different purposes, A,
B and C representing the push buttons;
D, the bells; E, the batteries, and G,
the ground. The simplest possible
connection is shown in Fig.&nbsp;1, the bell
D, battery E, and push button A, are
all connected in series. The operation
of the bell is independent of the order
in which the bell, battery, and push
button are placed, so long as there is a
complete circuit when the push button
is pressed. One of the wires in
this circuit may be done away with by
completing the circuit through the
ground, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2. Connecting
a bell as shown in this diagram
often results in quite a saving of wire.
The proper connections for operating
one bell from either of two push
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_357' name='Page_357' href='#Page_357'>[357]</a></span>
buttons, A or B, is shown in Fig.&nbsp;3.
Two bells, D, operated from a single
push button, C, are connected as shown
in Fig.&nbsp;4. The two bells, D, are shown
connected in parallel, which requires
more wire than if they were connected
in series. If they be connected in series,
one or the other should have its
make-and-break contact closed. The
bell whose circuit remains unchanged
will intercept the current for the other
bell in series with it. The operating
of the bells is more satisfactory, however,
when they are in parallel, and
each taking current from the battery
independent of the other.

  <p>Wiring Diagrams for Return-Call Bells (Fig.&nbsp;7, Fig.&nbsp;8, Fig.&nbsp;9)</p>
</div>

<p>
The proper connections for what is
called a return-call circuit is shown in
Fig.&nbsp;7. The circuit is so arranged that
the bell at one end is controlled by
the push button at the other end. Such
a circuit can be used in transmitting
signals in either direction. A ground
return-call circuit is shown in Fig.&nbsp;8.
In the circuits shown in Figs. 7 and 8,
only one battery is needed.
</p>

<p>
The connections of a two-wire metallic
return-call circuit are shown in
Fig.&nbsp;9. A special push button must be
used in this circuit, and in this case
two batteries are used instead of one,
as in Figs. 7 and 8. This circuit may
be changed to a ground return-call
circuit by using the earth as a conductor
instead of either wire. There
are, of course, numerous other methods
that may be used in connecting
call bells, but the connections shown
in the diagrams are perhaps the most common.

<h2>
How to Build a Simple Electric Motor<br />
By A. G. McClure
</h2>


<p>
An exceedingly simple and inexpensive
motor that may be used in operating
small toys can be constructed as
follows: First procure a good permanent
magnet, about 5&nbsp;in. long and
about 1-1/2&nbsp;in. between the inside edges
at the open end. This magnet should
be at least 1/2&nbsp;in. thick, and if it cannot
be had in one piece, two or more
may be placed side by side, like poles
being placed together. The writer
was unable to procure ready-made
magnets, so one was formed and magnetized.
Obtain a piece of tungsten
or some other good-grade steel, 1/2&nbsp;in.
by 1/2&nbsp;in., and about 11&nbsp;in. long. Bend
this piece into the form of a U, with
the inner edges 1-3/4&nbsp;in. apart. Square
off both ends and drill two small holes
in the outside surface of each end, at
AA, about 3/8&nbsp;in. from the end. Tap
these holes for small machine screws.
Drill the hole B with a small drill,
about 1/16&nbsp;in., in the center of the lower
portion of the U and ream it out. The
piece should now be clamped with a
good pair of blacksmith's tongs,&mdash;a
block of iron being placed between the
ends to keep the pressure of the tongs
from drawing them together&mdash;heated
to a cherry red and then plunged into
a bath of oil. It can then be magnetized
by placing it in contact with a
permanent magnet.

  </a>
  <p>Detail of Armature Laminations, and Completed Parts
Assembled, but without Armature Windings</p>
</div>

<p>
Next obtain a piece of 1/8-in. brass,
about 1/2&nbsp;in. wide and 5-1/2&nbsp;in. long.
Drill two holes in each end of the
piece to match those drilled in the
ends of the magnet, also one in the
center, and tap it for a 1/8-in. machine
screw. Now bend this piece into the
form shown.  Provide a machine
screw, S, for the hole C and drill a small
tapered hole in the end of the screw.
</p>

<p>
Obtain a small quantity of soft sheet
iron and cut a sufficient number of
pieces similar to that shown at D to
make a pile 1/2&nbsp;in high. Cut two
pieces of the same size from some
thin sheet brass. Now place all of
these pieces in a pile, the brass pieces
being on the outside, and clamp them
securely, then drill the two small holes,
E and F. Place two small copper rivets
in these holes and rivet the heads
down before removing the clamp.
Drill a 1/8-in. hole, G, through this
piece, the armature, for the shaft to
pass through. Procure a piece of 1/8-in.
steel rod, about 6&nbsp;in. long. Sharpen
one end so that it will enter the hole
B, then cut the other end off and
sharpen it so that it will enter the
opening made in the end of the screw S.
The armature may now be soldered to
this shaft, its left-hand surface being
flush with the ends of the magnet.
</p>

<p>
A small commutator, H, should now
be made as follows: Obtain a piece of
thin brass tubing about 5/8&nbsp;in. in diameter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_360' name='Page_360' href='#Page_360'>[360]</a></span>
Turn down a piece of hard rubber
so that the tube will fit tightly on
it. Drill a hole in this piece of rubber
of such a size that it will have to
be forced on the steel shaft. Saw two
longitudinal slots in the brass tube
diametrically opposite each other and
then bind these two pieces in place on
the piece of rubber with some heavy
linen thread wrapped around each end.
The armature is now ready to wind.
Get a small quantity of No. 22 gauge
cotton-covered wire, solder one end to
one of the segments of the commutator,
then wind one end of the armature
full and cross over and wind the other
end full, soldering the end of the wire
to the second commutator segment.
Make sure to wind both ends of the
armature in the same direction so the
current in both parts of the winding
produces magnetizing effects in the
same direction. Insulate the winding
from the core and the different layers
from each other with a good quality
of thin writing paper.
</p>

<p>
Two small brushes should now be
made from some thin spring brass and
mounted on the brass piece as shown.
These brushes should be insulated
from the piece of brass and two small
binding posts should be provided for
making connections to them. The position
of the commutator and brushes
should be such that the brushes move
from one segment to the other when
the ends of the armature are directly
in line with the ends of the permanent magnet.
</p>

<p>
A small pulley should be mounted
upon the shaft to be used in transmitting
the power. The whole device
may be mounted in a horizontal position
on a wooden base as shown, and
the motor is complete.

How to Make a Humidity Indicator
</h2>


<p>
A simple weather indicator that
may be used in determining the condition
of the atmosphere may be made
as follows: Dress a small figure, in
the form of a doll, with a piece of
cloth, previously dipped in the following
solution: Chloride of cobalt,
30 parts by weight; sodium chloride,
15 parts; gum arabic, 7-1/2 parts; calcium
chloride, 4-1/2 parts, and water,
400 parts. This cloth will change
color as the amount of moisture in
the atmosphere changes, the change
being due to the cobalt salt, which, in
dry air, is lavender blue. As the moisture
in the atmosphere increases, the
color changes first to bluish red, then
light red and finally pink, according
to the amount of moisture. With a
decrease in moisture, the colors change
in the reverse order to that given
above, and the blue color returns when
the air becomes dry.

<h2>
The "Q" Trick
</h2>


<p>
Lay out the form of the capital letter
Q with coins on a table and ask
someone in the audience to select a
number and then
ask that person
to count up
from one until
the number is
reached, beginning
at A and
stopping on the
circle, for instance
at B, then
counting back
again beginning
with one, but,
instead of counting
on the tail, pass it and go around
the circle, say, to C. The performer
gives these instructions to the person
doing the counting. The one selecting
the number must not tell the performer
what the number is, and the
latter is to leave the room while the
counting proceeds. The performer,
before leaving the room, is to tell
which coin will be the last one counted.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img360'>
  <img src='images/img360.png' alt='img360' title='img360' />
</div>

<p>
Take, for example, the number 7.
Counting from A to B there are just
7 coins and counting back the last
number or 7 will be at C. Try 9 for
the number and the last one counted
will also be C. The number of coins
in the tail represents the number of
coins in the circle from the intersection
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_361' name='Page_361' href='#Page_361'>[361]</a></span>
of the tail and circle to the last
number counted. For instance, the
sketch shows 4 coins in the tail, therefore
the last coin counted in the circle
will be at C or the fourth coin from
the intersection of the tail and circle.
</p>

<p>
By slipping another coin in the tail
the location of the last coin counted
is changed, thereby eliminating any
chance of exposing the trick by locating
the same coin in the circle every
time. This can be done secretly without
being noticed.

<h2>
An Electric Time Light
</h2>


<p>
Although the modern alarm clock is
a wonderfully effective piece of mechanism,
it is, to say the least, very abrupt
in its manner. It seldom confines
its efforts to
the chamber of
its owner, but
spreads its disturbance
all over
the building. It
is very easy for a
person to arise
early in the summer
and no
greater difficulty
should be experienced
in winter, if
the bedroom is
brightly lighted
at the proper
hour. To do this
simply and automatically became the
problem.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img362'>
  <img src='images/img362.png' alt='img362' title='img362' />
</div>

<p>
The first thought was to obtain one
of those clock-actuated electric-light
switches, such as the stores use, but
this would not do, because it meant
some unsightly wiring around the
room. It was then remembered how,
in the course of some experiments, an
ordinary incandescent light was operated
through a piece of No. 36 gauge
wire without any sign of heating. If,
then, a wire only 1/200&nbsp;in. in diameter
were of ample carrying capacity, surely
a dollar watch would be sufficient to
make the connection. Such being the
case, the whole mechanism could
readily be attached to the drop cord of
a lamp directly above the socket, thus
obviating any additional wiring. This
all proved to be true, and the whole
was made and attached in the course
of a couple of hours.
</p>

<p>
While one might feel enthusiastic
about this small and easily contrived
affair, it is scarcely to be presumed
that it would operate so effectively on
one who had spent the larger part of
the night tripping the "light fantastic,"
or in undue conviviality. An ordinary
16-cp. globe has thus far operated perfectly,
and a 40-watt tungsten lamp
would, if not too far away, surely
awaken the hardest sleeper of sober habits.
</p>

<p>
The base of the mechanism is a small
piece of 1/4-in. hard wood, upon which
is fastened a small brass bracket, A,
bent so as to hold the watch from
slipping down. A small clip, B, was
then arranged so as to grip the neck
of the watch after its lower edge had
been placed against A, and a small
brad at either side prevented lateral
movement. In this way the watch was
held firmly, yet in a manner that would
permit its being taken out instantly
when necessary. The glass and minute
hand were removed. The brass
bolt from an exhausted dry cell was
placed at C, so as to clamp a small copper
washer to which was soldered a
narrow strip of copper, D, about 1/16&nbsp;in.
wide and cut from a leaf of an old
dynamo brush. This strip is arranged
so as to wipe the hour hand as it
travels past, but being so thin, it has
no appreciable effect on the time keeping.
As illustrated, the device is set
for six o'clock, but by loosening the
nut C an hour's adjustment either way
may be had. It is a very simple matter,
however, to arrange the device so it
will operate at any hour. In connecting
up, one end of the drop cord is
removed from the socket and attached
to A, which throws the current through
the watch, thence along the hand and
down D to C, from where it is carried
by a short piece of wire to the
socket again. As there are so many
circuits through the watch, the small
current required for one light does not
affect it in any way. Thus far, no
trouble has been experienced in making
this delicate connection with 110
volts, but if any should develop, the
contacts may be tipped with the small
pieces of platinum taken from a
burned-out globe.

  <p>The Shocking Coil as It is Used
for Amusement, or in the
Manner a Current is Given a Patient</p>
</div>

<p>
An amusing as well as instructive
shocking machine, usually called
a medical coil, can be easily
constructed from a discarded
buzzer or electric bell, four
binding posts, some pieces of
insulated wire, two carbon
rods, and a rheostat.

Rheostat are Fastened, and the
Electrical Connections (Fig.&nbsp;1, Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>

  <p>The Rheostat That is
Used to Regulate the Flow of
Current in the Carbon
Hand Pieces (Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
A base for attaching the
parts is made of a piece of
poplar, 10&nbsp;in. long, 5&nbsp;in. wide,
and 1/2&nbsp;in. thick, which
can be finished as desired,
but a good
method is to shape the
edge like molding and
give it a mahogany
stain, and when dry
apply a coat of white
shellac, which should
be allowed to dry a
day, whereupon the
surface is rubbed with prepared wax.
When the base is ready, mount the
buzzer at one end. This can be easily
done by making an L-shaped piece of
metal, A, which is fastened to the base
with a screw, and to the yoke of the
magnet coil with a small bolt. If the
armature and its connections are also
used from the buzzer, the height of the
coils must be taken in consideration.
These parts are fastened in position as
shown, using an L-shaped piece of
metal, B, for the spring end. The screw
holding the armature spring to the
base, as well as the vibrator screw,
should be of such a length that it will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_364' name='Page_364' href='#Page_364'>[364]</a></span>
enter the base far enough to permit a
connection for a wire in a countersunk
hole bored in the base from the under
side. Binding posts are placed in the
corners of the base in holes countersunk
from the under side for the screw heads.
</p>

<p>
The rheostat is of the miniature-battery
type, which has a round base and
a coil of resistance wire with a lever
passing over the coil. Such a rheostat
can be purchased from an electrical
store, but if the person constructing
the shocking machine desires to make
one, it is not difficult if a lathe is at hand.
</p>

<p>
To make the rheostat, turn up a disk,
about 3&nbsp;in. in diameter, from a piece
of hard wood, such as oak, maple, or
walnut, and form a circular groove
in the upper surface, about 3/8&nbsp;in. inside
of the circumference. The groove is
to admit a circular coil of resistance
wire, and in making it, be sure to have
it the proper size to take the coil
snugly. The coil can be of any size,
and to make it, resistance wire is
wound around a piece of wire used as
a mandrel. If the coil is 1/4&nbsp;in., or a
trifle smaller, in diameter, it will make
a good size. Be sure that the depth
of the groove is such that it will allow
a part of the coils of the resistance wire
to project above the surface of the
wood disk. The coil of wire should
be just long enough to fit in the groove
and allow a 1-in. space between the
ends, one of which is anchored to the
base, at C, the other being attached
to the binding post D. Drill a hole
through the center of the disk and fasten
a lever, taken from a switch, or one
made of a piece of sheet brass, that
will extend from the center to the outside
of the disk, or over the resistance-wire
coil. A small handle is attached
to the outer end. A connection is made
from the center support of the lever to
the binding post E.
</p>

<p>
The connections for the buzzer and
rheostat are made on the under side
of the base, where grooves are cut to
run the wires in, so that they will be
below the surface of the wood. In
the diagram, the binding post F is connected
to the binding post D of the
rheostat, which in turn is connected to
the screw of the make-and-break point
G. The other binding post H is connected
to the bracket B supporting the
armature spring. The binding post E
of the rheostat is connected to the base
binding post J. The magnet coils are
connected, as shown, from K to L, and
from M to B.
</p>

<p>
The two pieces of carbon, which are
used for the hand pieces, are connected
with silk-insulated wire. These connections
are made to the binding posts
F and H. The other two binding posts,
J and L, are connected to a battery.
The carbons used may be purchased,
or taken from an old battery. Two
or more dry cells are used for the
current. The rheostat controls the
amount of current passing through the
hand pieces.&mdash;Contributed by Gilbert

<h2>
Secret Compartment in Ordinary Table Drawer
</h2>


<p>
It is frequently desired to have some
handy place for storing valuables where
there is but little chance of discovering
them. Secret drawers in tables usually
require special and expensive changes,
but with only a few simple changes on
a regular drawer of any ordinary table,
a secret compartment can be made
which is as secure as can ordinarily be
figured on, outside of a steel safe. Having
chosen the desired table, a partition
should be placed across the entire back
part of the drawer, allowing for necessary
space in the secret compartment.
This partition should resemble the real
back of the drawer as closely as it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_365' name='Page_365' href='#Page_365'>[365]</a></span>
possible to make it. The compartment
must not be too wide, for the resulting
small width of the front part of the
drawer might then arouse suspicion.
On the lower side of the secret compartment
a strip of wood, A, should be
attached with a screw, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;1, allowing sufficient looseness so
the strip may be turned end for end
when necessary. With the strip set as
shown, it will strike the front side B
of the table when the drawer is pulled
out, leaving the secret compartment
still hidden. In order to expose this, it
will be necessary to turn the strip, as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;2, when the drawer can
be pulled out to its full length.
</p>

  <p>Two Positions of the Strip for Holding, or Giving
Access to, the Secret Part, and a Hinged Strip (Fig.&nbsp;1, Fig.&nbsp;2, Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
It being necessary that the strip A be
as long as the secret compartment is
wide, to fully expose this, there may be
cases where the drawer is not wide
enough to allow the strip A to turn
around. In that case the strip can be
hinged to the back of the drawer as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;3. When it is hanging
down, as shown by the dotted outline,
the drawer may be pulled out to its full
extent. When it is desired to lock the
secret compartment, the hinged strip
must be swung up in position, and fastened.
An ordinary thumbscrew or eye
can be used which, by a turn or two,
will either release it or fasten it in
place.&mdash;Contributed by Paul Durst, Detroit, Mich.

<h2>
Inflating Handballs
</h2>


<p>
When handballs become "dead," or
no longer bounce freely, they may frequently
be restored by inflating them
with air. This can be done by means
of a bulb attached to a hypodermic
needle. The needle must be inserted
through the soft plug which every inflated
ball has, and which can be discovered
by pressure. After the ball is
inflated and the needle extracted, the
soft rubber closes around the fine hole,
preventing the escape of the air. If a
leak is found, which allows the air to
escape too rapidly, a repair can be
made with a single-tube tire outfit.&mdash;Contributed

Measuring the Length of Wire Wound on a Spool
</h2>


<p>
When winding magnet spools on a
lathe, the exact amount of wire used
can be easily determined by means of
the device shown in the illustration.
The large reel from which the wire is
obtained is conveniently placed on a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_366' name='Page_366' href='#Page_366'>[366]</a></span>
loose mandrel, or rod, near the lathe,
and in line with the spool which is to be
wound. A grooved idler wheel, the exact
diameter of which is known, is supported
between the spool and wire reel
so it may freely revolve; the number of
its revolutions should be obtained, automatically,
by a revolution counter.
When using the device, the wire from
the reel is placed once around the idler
to insure the necessary grip to prevent
it from sliding; then it is led to the
spool. The exact diameter of the idler
being known and the number of revolutions
indicated, the true length of the
wire wound on the spools can be easily
determined by the following formula:
Length of wire on spool in feet equals
circumference of idler in feet times
number of revolutions of idler.&mdash;Contributed

provided with a regular coupling for
connecting it to the line of good hose.
The other end is turned up for several
inches, and securely wired to the main
part, thereby shutting off any flow
through it. Several cuts are made into
it, about halfway across and 6&nbsp;in. apart.
If the water is forced in, the only means
of escape will be through the slots,
which will produce fine sprays, giving
as good service as a manufactured
sprinkler.&mdash;Contributed by A. B. Shaw,

  <p>Six Pieces of Wood as They are Put Together to

</div>

<p>
In its construction, six pieces of hard
wood, of the dimensions shown in the
sketch, are required. White wood will
do if there is no hard wood at hand.
The coin slot is 1/8&nbsp;in. wide by 1-1/4&nbsp;in.
long, and is cut in only one piece.
</p>

<p>
No difficulty will be experienced in
putting the first five pieces together,
but the sixth, or top, piece, shown in
the sketch, will not go in, because the
bottom edge of the raised side will
strike the inside of the piece to the
right. By beveling this edge with a
chisel from top to bottom between the
dadoes, or grooves, it can be forced
down quite a distance and sprung in
place by placing a block of wood on
the high side and striking it a sharp
blow with a heavy hammer.&mdash;Contributed

An Electric Anemometer<br />
By Wm. H. Dettman
</h2>


<p>
The construction of this instrument
is so simple that any amateur can
make one and if accurate calibrations
are desired, these can be marked by
comparison with a standard anemometer,
while both are placed in the wind.
</p>


<h3>
The Indicator
</h3>

<p>
The case of the indicator is built of
thin wood&mdash;the material of an old
cigar box will do&mdash;9&nbsp;in. long, 6&nbsp;in. wide
and 1-1/2&nbsp;in. deep. If cigar-box material
is used, it must first be soaked
in warm water to remove the paper.
If a cover is to be used on the box, a
slot, on an arc of a circle, must be cut
through it to show the scale beneath.
The arc is determined by the length of
the needle from a center over the axis
on which the needle swings. When
the box is completed, smooth up the
outside surface with fine sandpaper
and give it a coat of stain.
</p>

<p>
The core of the magnet is made by
winding several layers of bond paper
around a pencil of sufficient size to
make an inside diameter of slightly
over 1/4&nbsp;in., and a tube 2&nbsp;in. long. Each
layer of the paper is glued to the preceding layer.
</p>

<p>
Two flanges or disks are attached to
the tube to form a spool for the wire.
The disks are cut from thin wood, 1-1/4&nbsp;in. square, and a hole bored through
their centers so that each will fit on
the tube tightly. One of them is glued
to one end of the tube and the other
fastened at a point 1/2&nbsp;in. from the opposite
end. The space between the
disks is filled with seven layers of No.
22 gauge insulated magnet wire, allowing
sufficient ends of the wire to project
for connections. The finished coil
is located in the box, as shown at A, Fig.&nbsp;1.

into which brass strips are inserted
and soldered, or otherwise fastened.
The strips of brass are 3/16&nbsp;in.
wide, one 1-1/2&nbsp;in. long and the other 3/4&nbsp;in. Two 1/16&nbsp;in. holes are drilled in the
end of the long piece, and one 1/16&nbsp;in.

of wood fitted in the U-shaped piece of
brass and made to turn on brads as
bearings, the center being pierced to
receive the end of the needle. After
locating the bearing for the axis C,
Fig.&nbsp;1, it is fastened in place so that
the upper end or pointer of the needle
will travel over the scale. The needle
is then attached to the bearing after
having been passed through the inner

core, and the coil is fitted with the core
in the manner shown at D. A light
brass coil spring is attached to each
end of the core, as shown at E and F,
the latter being held with a string, G,
whose end is tied to a brad on the outside
of the box, for adjustment. A better
device could be substituted by attaching
the end of the spring F to a nut
and using a knurled-head bolt passed
through the box side. One of the
wires from the coil is attached to a
push button, H, to be used when a
reading of the instrument is made.
The connections for the instrument
consist of one binding post and a push button.

differs from the windmill in that the
revolving wheel is replaced by a cupped
disk, A, Fig.&nbsp;4, fitted with a sliding
metal shaft, B, which is supported on
crosspieces, CC, between the main
frame pieces DD. The latter pieces
carry a vane at the opposite end. The
frame pieces are 1/2&nbsp;in. thick, 2-1/4&nbsp;in.
wide and 36&nbsp;in. long, and the crosspieces
have the same width and thickness
and are 4&nbsp;in. long.

<div class='img' id='img368c'>
  <img src='images/img368c.png'

  <p>(Fig.&nbsp;5)</p>
</div>

<p>
A variable-resistance coil, E, is
made as follows and fastened in the
main frame. The core of this coil is a
piece of wood, 2&nbsp;in. square and 4&nbsp;in.
long, and wound with No. 18 gauge
single-wound cotton-covered german-silver
wire. The winding should begin
1/4&nbsp;in. from one end of the core and
finish 1/4&nbsp;in. from the other, making the
length of the coil 3-1/2&nbsp;in. The ends of
the wire are secured by winding them
around the heads of brads driven into
the core. A small portion of the insulation
is removed from the wire on
one side of the coil. This may be done
with a piece of emery cloth or sandpaper.
A sliding spring contact, F, is
attached to the sliding shaft B, the
end of which is pressed firmly on the
bared portion of the wire coil. One
end of a coil spring, which is slipped
on the shaft between the pieces CC, is
attached to the end crosspiece, and the
other end is fastened to the sliding
shaft so as to keep
the shaft and disk
out, and the flange
H against the
second crosspiece,
when there is no
air current applied
to the disk A.
The insulation
of the standard
upon which the
anemometer turns
is shown in Fig.&nbsp;5. The standard J is
made of a piece of 1/2-in. pipe, suitably
and rigidly attached to the building
or support, and the upper end, around
which the anemometer revolves to keep
in the direction of the air currents, is
fitted with a plug of wood to insulate
the 1/4-in. brass rod K. A bearing and
electric-wire connection plate, L, is
made of brass, 1/8&nbsp;in. thick, 2&nbsp;in. wide
and 4&nbsp;in. long. The bearing and connection
plate M are made in a similar
manner. The surface of the holes in
these plates, bearing against the pipe
J and the brass rod K, make the two
connections for the wires from the
variable-resistance coil E, Fig.&nbsp;4, located
on the main frame, to the wire
connections between the two instruments.
These wires should be
weather-proof, insulated, attached as
shown, and running to and connecting

</p>

<p>
Two or more dry cells must be connected
in the line, and when a reading
is desired, the button H, Fig.&nbsp;1, is
pushed, which causes the current to
flow through the lines and draw the
magnet core D in the coil, in proportion
to the magnetic force induced by
the amount of current passing through
the resistance in the coils on E, Fig.&nbsp;4,
from the contact into which the spring
F is brought by the wind pressure on
the disk A.

When the sides of a boat become
scored or bruised scrape the parts clean
and fill the depressions with wood cement.
The wood cement or stick cement,
as it is called, can be procured
from a paint store. Heat the cement
with a blowtorch and apply it to the
bruised parts. Use a heated putty
knife to smooth the cement and make
the surface level. After sandpapering
the fills and applying a coat of paint
the boat sides will look as good as new.
The cement will not chip or fall out.&mdash;Contributed

How to Make an Electric Lamp Flasher
</h2>


<p>
Procure two pieces of metal, one of
brass and the other of sheet iron, 5&nbsp;in.
long, 1/2&nbsp;in. wide, and 1/32&nbsp;in., or just a
little more, in thickness. Bend the
brass strip into the form shown in Fig.
1, then place the brass piece on top of
the iron and drill the holes A and B
indicated in Fig.&nbsp;2. After the brass
piece has been bent, as shown in Fig.
1, it will of course be shorter than the
iron strip and the iron strip must be
cut off, or a brass strip a little longer
than 5&nbsp;in. can be secured and cut the
same length as the iron strip after it is
bent. The holes A and B should be
3/32&nbsp;in. in diameter. The next thing to
do will be to wind a heating coil about
the brass strip. Wrap a very thin layer
of sheet asbestos about the brass strip,
and wind on the strip 18&nbsp;ft. of No. 34
gauge bare superior resistance wire.
Use a thread about .006&nbsp;in. in diameter
to separate the various turns. This
thread can be removed after the winding
is completed and the ends have
been fastened. Rivet the iron and
brass pieces together with a small
brass rivet in the hole A, Fig.&nbsp;2. After
the two pieces are riveted together
bend them into the form shown in Fig.
4 and then drill the two 1/8-in. holes C
and D, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2. Tap the
hole B, Fig.&nbsp;2, to take a small machine screw.

<p>
The base is constructed as follows:
Procure a piece of slate, 5-3/8&nbsp;in. long,
1-1/2&nbsp;in. wide, and 1/2&nbsp;in. in thickness.
Drill the holes indicated in Fig.&nbsp;3.
The four corner holes are for mounting
the flasher in its containing case,
and should be about 1/8&nbsp;in. in
diameter. The holes E, F, G, and H
should be 1/8&nbsp;in. in diameter and
countersunk with a 3/8-in. square-ended
drill, on the under side, to a depth
of 3/16 or 1/4&nbsp;in. Cut from some 1/16-in.
sheet brass a piece 1-3/8&nbsp;in. long, and
1/2&nbsp;in. wide.  Drill two 1/8-in. holes
in this piece, 7/8&nbsp;in. apart and equally
spaced from the ends. Procure four
1/8-in. brass bolts, two 1/2&nbsp;in. in length,
and two 1&nbsp;in. in length. Secure four
small washers and two additional
nuts. Mount the combined iron and
brass strip on the slate base, using a
long and short bolt as shown in Fig.
4. One terminal of the winding should
be placed under the head of the bolt J.
Place a washer, K, between the head of
the bolt and the wire. The brass strip
L can now be mounted in a similar
manner, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. Place
the other end of the winding under the
head of the bolt M.

  <p>The Assembled Parts Showing the Complete Flasher
and Electric Connections with Adjusting Screw (Fig.&nbsp;4)</p>
</div>

<p>
Obtain a small screw, N, Fig.&nbsp;4, of
such a length that its point will reach
the brass strip L when the screw is
placed in the hole B, Fig.&nbsp;2. A lock
nut, O, should be provided for this
screw so that it will remain in adjustment.
The point of the screw and the
point on the brass plate where the
screw touches should be of platinum,
as the brass will not withstand the
high temperature of the arc formed
when the circuit is broken.
</p>

<p>
A metal box should now be provided
to serve as a containing case and the
flasher is complete. This box should
be of such design and construction that
it will comply with the requirements
of the electrical inspection department
having jurisdiction over the locality
where the flasher is to be used.
</p>

<p>
The flasher should be connected in
series with the lamp, the wires being
fastened under the nuts on the bolts P
and R, Fig.&nbsp;4, and the screw N adjusted
so that it lacks a small fraction
of an inch of making contact with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_371' name='Page_371' href='#Page_371'>[371]</a></span>
brass plate when there is no current in
the winding. When the switch is
turned on there will be a current
through the lamp and winding in
series. The brass strip will be heated
more than the iron and it will expand
more, thus forcing the point of the
screw N down upon the brass plate,
which will result in the winding about
the brass strip being shorted and the
full voltage will be impressed upon
the lamp, and it will burn at normal
candlepower. When the coil is shorted
there will of course be no current in
its winding and the brass strip will
cool down, the screw N will finally
be drawn away from contact with
the brass plate, and the winding again
connected in series with the lamp. The
lamp will apparently go out when the
winding is in series with it, as the total
resistance of the lamp and winding
combined will not permit sufficient
current to pass through the lamp to
make its filament glow. The time
the lamp is on and off may be varied
to a certain extent by adjusting the screw N.

Timing Photograph Prints
</h2>


<p>
An amateur photographer insists
that a timing clock in the darkroom is
a needless luxury. In order to time
printing exposures, which he does with
a pendant tungsten light under a reflecting
shade, he simply fastens the
electric-light cord so that the lamp and
shade will act like a pendulum bob
which beats the seconds. Of course
he makes no effort to be exact, but if
the distance between the lamp and the
point of suspension of the cord be
about 39 or 40&nbsp;in., the beats will be
very nearly seconds. When the light
is turned on, it is started swinging,
and the operator can thus easily count
seconds with sufficient accuracy, and,
besides, it readily furnishes a guide for
duplicating printing results.
</p>

<p>
The same principle can be applied
to camera exposures, if so desired, by
the following plan. Select some suitable
place on the under side of the tripod
plate, as, for instance, the screw
head, and fasten a small string, having
a weight attached to it about 39&nbsp;in. from the point of support. Like
the swinging lamp, this device too, will
beat seconds. For convenience, one
of the tripod legs may be marked to
indicate the length of string needed,
so that the operator at any time can
quickly fasten a string, measure off
the right length on the tripod leg, attach
a bunch of keys, a knife, or any
other convenient weight, even a small
stone, and have a second-beating pendulum
for time exposures.&mdash;Contributed

  <p>The Furnace Consists of a Flowerpot in Which a Crucible is Set, and on Either Side
the Carbon Holders are Fastened to the Base (Fig.&nbsp;5)</p>
</div>

<p>
A small electric furnace that will be
very serviceable in a laboratory may
be made as follows:
</p>

<p>
First procure a small clay flowerpot,
about 4&nbsp;in. in diameter at the bottom,
and also a small clay crucible, about 2&nbsp;in. in diameter at the bottom and at
least 1&nbsp;in. less in height than the
flowerpot, and having as nearly as possible
the same slope to its sides as the
pot. Now obtain a small quantity of
asbestos compound and pack it around
the small crucible inside the flowerpot.
Make sure the crucible is in the
exact center of the flowerpot and that
their tops are even with each other.
Assuming that ordinary electric-light
carbons are to be used, which are
about 1/2&nbsp;in. in diameter, drill two 5/8-in.
holes, exactly opposite each other,
through the walls of the flowerpot and
asbestos compound so that they enter
the crucible about 3/4&nbsp;in. above its bottom
on the inside. A suitable lid for
the furnace may be made from 1/4-in.
sheet asbestos and should be large
enough to cover the top of the flowerpot.

  <p>(Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
The feeds and supports for the carbon
electrodes are constructed as follows:
Procure two pieces of 1/8-in.
brass, 1&nbsp;in. wide and 9&nbsp;in. long. Cut a
1/8-in. groove lengthwise in the center
of these pieces to within 1-1/2&nbsp;in. of
each end, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. Drill
four 1/8-in. holes, AA, in each piece, a
3/8-in. hole, B, in one end and a 3/16-in.
hole, C, in the other end. Now bend
the ends up at right angles to the remainder
of the piece along the dotted
lines shown at D and E. Next obtain
two 3/8-in. rods, 10-3/16&nbsp;in. long. Turn
one end of each down to a 3/16-in. diameter
for a distance of 3/8&nbsp;in. From that
point thread the same end of the rods
for a distance of 6&nbsp;in. Drill a 1/16-in.
hole in each end of the rods a little less
than 1/4&nbsp;in. from the ends. The dimensions
of the rods are given in Fig.&nbsp;2.
Two small rubber or wooden handles,
similar to the one shown in Fig.&nbsp;3,
should now be made and fastened to
the large ends of the rods by means of
1/16-in. steel pins. Obtain two pieces of
brass of approximately the following
dimensions: 1&nbsp;in. by 1&nbsp;in. by 3&nbsp;in. Drill
four holes in each of these pieces as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. The hole H should be
just large enough to allow the carbon
to enter, or about 1/2&nbsp;in. in diameter.
The hole G should be tapped to take
a 1/4-in. machine screw, the hole F
should be threaded so that the threaded
rods will enter, and a small binding
post should be mounted on a lug fastened
in the hole J. Cut away one end
of this piece as shown in Fig.&nbsp;4 until it
is a little less than 1/8&nbsp;in. in thickness,
or so it will enter the grooves cut in
the brass strips.

  <p>(Fig.&nbsp;4)</p>
</div>

<p>
The parts of the furnace are now
ready to assemble, which may be done
as follows: Procure a piece of well
seasoned board, hard wood if possible,
about 1&nbsp;in. thick, 8&nbsp;in. wide and perhaps
20&nbsp;in. long. Cover one side of
this board and the edges with some 1/8-in.
sheet asbestos. Now place the
flowerpot in the exact center and then
mount the grooved brass strips one on
either side of it with the longest dimension
parallel to the longest dimension
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_374' name='Page_374' href='#Page_374'>[374]</a></span>
of the board and the inside end
about 1&nbsp;in. from the side of the pot.
The end with the 3/16-in. holes should
be next to the pot. Assemble the
parts of the carbon feeds and then cut
out some circular disks of asbestos to
place under the flowerpot so as to
raise it to such a position
that the holes in its sides
will be on a line with the
carbon rods. Three long
screws should now be
placed in the board, forming
the base, in such a
position as to hold the
flowerpot always in place.
This completes the furnace
proper, which is
shown in Fig.&nbsp;5.
</p>

<p>
The furnace can now be put
into operation provided there is a suitable
current rheostat to connect in series
with the carbon arc to prevent an
excessive current being taken from the
line. If such a rheostat is not available,
a serviceable one may be made as follows:
</p>

<p>
Obtain two pieces of 1/16-in. sheet
iron, 6 by 6&nbsp;in., that are to form the
end plates. Cut off the corners of one
piece so as to form an octagon and
drill a number of 1/8-in. and 1/4-in. holes
in it, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;6. Bend the
corners of the other piece down along
the dotted lines marked L, Fig.&nbsp;7, and
then make a second bend in each corner
along the dotted lines K, so that
the outermost portion of the corner is
parallel to the main portion of the
piece. Drill a number of
1/8-in. holes in this piece as
indicated. A 3-in. opening
should be cut in the center
of this piece to
give access to the interior of the completed
rheostat. Now obtain eight 3/8-in.
iron rods, 10&nbsp;in. long. Drill and
tap each end of these rods to accommodate
a 1/8-in. machine screw. Wrap
several layers of thin sheet asbestos
around each rod and tie it in place
with some thread. These rods should
now be fastened between the end
plates by means of a number of
iron machine screws. Mount four
back-connected binding posts on the
plate shown in Fig.&nbsp;6, making sure
they are insulated from the plate by
means of suitable bushings and washers.

<p>
Procure a small quantity of No.
14 gauge iron wire. Fasten one end
of the wire under the head of the screw
holding one of the binding posts in
place and then wind it around the rods
about 20 times, making the distance
between the turns equal to the diameter
of the wire. After winding on the
20 turns, attach a short piece of wire
to the main wire and fasten the free
end of the short piece to one of
the other binding posts.
Wind on 20 more turns, and
make another connection to
the third binding post,
then complete the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_375' name='Page_375' href='#Page_375'>[375]</a></span>
winding and attach the end to the
remaining binding post. Different
amounts of this resistance can now be
connected in series with the arc by
changing the connections from one
binding post to another. The rheostat
may be located on a bracket fastened
to the wall, but care must be taken not
to place it in such a position that it will
come into contact with inflammable
material. As an extra precaution, the
circuit should be properly fused.

parts; water, 2 parts, and nitric acid, 1
part, until they become covered with a
dark deposit. Take them from the
solution and remove the black substance
with a fine scratch brush. After
cleaned in this manner, rinse in hot
water and dry in hot sawdust.

<h2>
An Electric Gas Lighter
</h2>


<p>
A very simple and inexpensive electric
gas-lighting device is shown in the
accompanying illustration. The gas is
ignited by means of an electric spark
which is produced between the two
parts A and B of an electric circuit.
This circuit is composed of a source of
electrical energy, such as a number of
dry cells, a kick coil, the connecting
leads, and a special operating switch
for opening and closing the circuit to
produce the spark. The circuit is normally
open, but as the lever controlling
the gas valve is moved from one
position to the other, by pulling the
chains, the lever C is caused to move
through a certain arc. Now, as this
lever C moves, its upper end passes
the projecting point B, which is attached
to the upper portion of the
burner, and the electric circuit will be
completed and broken. Just as the
point A leaves contact with the point
B an arc will be produced. This arc is
greatly intensified by the kick coil,
which acts as a sort of reservoir in
which energy is stored while the circuit
is closed, and upon opening the
circuit this stored energy is given out
by the kick coil and increases the size
of the arc.
</p>

  <p>The Igniting Points as
They are Attached to a
Gas Burner to Work
Automatically</p>
</div>

<p>
The points A and B should both be
made of platinum, as other metals will
not withstand the extremely high temperature
of the arc. Pieces of platinum
that will serve very nicely for the purpose
may be obtained from an old incandescent
lamp. The piece B is
mounted on a brass collar, D, by
means of a small screw, E. The brass
collar D is held in place by the screw
F, which draws the two ends together.
This collar must be insulated from the
stem or fixture by some thin sheets of
mica. The upper end of the piece of
platinum B should be just high
enough to come within the lower edge
of the gas flame.
</p>

<p>
Now mount an arm, C, on the valve
stem so that it stands in a vertical position
when the lever to which the
chains are attached is in a horizontal
position. Bend this arm into the form
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_377' name='Page_377' href='#Page_377'>[377]</a></span>
shown in the figure and cut its upper
end off so that it is about 1/2&nbsp;in. below
the outwardly projecting end of the
piece of platinum B. Drill a small hole
in the upper end of C, and insert a
piece of platinum and run some solder
around it.
</p>

<p>
Then the complete burner and valve
are mounted on the gas fixture, and
from the collar D an insulated wire is
run to the point where the battery and
kick coil are to be located. The gas
fixture itself is to form one side of the
electric circuit, and one terminal of the
battery should be connected to the gas
pipe as shown in the figure.
</p>

<p>
A kick coil may be made as follows:
Procure a small quantity of rather
small soft-iron wire and cut a sufficient
number of 8-in. lengths to make a
bundle about 7/8&nbsp;in. in diameter. From
some good writing paper make a tube,
8&nbsp;in. long and 7/8&nbsp;in. in outside diameter.
Use at least six layers of paper
and glue the various layers together in
forming this paper tube. After the
tube has dried thoroughly, fill it with
the pieces of iron wire until it is perfectly
hard. Cut from some 1/2-in.
hard wood, two pieces, 3&nbsp;in. square,
and drill a 7/8-in. hole in the center of
each of these to a depth of 3/8&nbsp;in. Now
glue these pieces to the completed core
and the winding can begin as soon as
the glue is dry. Wind on this spool
six layers of double cotton-covered
No. 18 gauge wire, insulating the various
layers from each other with several
thicknesses of good writing paper.
This coil is then mounted on a wooden
base and suitable terminals provided.
</p>

<p>
At least four dry cells will be required
to give satisfactory results.
Bear in mind that the gas must be escaping
from the burner when the arc
is formed. The adjustment of the arm
A, as given above, may result in the
gas valve being closed when the arc is
formed, and the device will then fail to
operate. If this is the case, the arm C
should be loosened and moved back so
that the circuit is broken at a later
time while the valve is being moved
from the "off" to "on" position. The
circuit should be closed for some little
time before it is opened so that some
energy may be stored in the kick coil.
If the wire A is made long enough to
project a short distance above B, it
will result in the circuit being closed
for a longer time than it would if they
just touched.

is extremely simple. Draw a
circle, about 1-1/2&nbsp;in. in diameter, on a
piece of paper and then draw a larger
circle, about 4&nbsp;in. in diameter, around
the first one. Divide the circles into 36
equal parts and draw lines from one
circle to the other like the spokes in a
wheel. These divisions will be 10&nbsp;deg.,
or 40 minutes of time, apart. They
should be numbered around the outside,
commencing at a point marked 0
and marking the numbers by tens each
way until they meet at 180&nbsp;deg.

Reversing Switch for Small Motors

<p>
A reversing switch made as follows
will be found very serviceable in
reversing the direction of the rotation
of small motors, changing the polarity
of electromagnets, etc.

  <p>Diagram of the Wiring to a Small Motor and the
Details of the Switch</p>
</div>

<p>
A diagram of the connections to the
switch and on the switch base is given
in the sketch, and in this particular
case the switch is shown connected to
a small toy motor. The field of the
motor is represented by A, the armature
by B; and C, D, E, and F are four
binding posts mounted on the base of
the switch; G, H, and I are three contacts;
J and K are terminals of the
switch blades, and L a single-pole
switch. The two blades of the reversing
switch have their lower ends fastened
to the terminals J and K, and
their upper ends, which are indicated
by arrow heads, may be moved over
the contacts G, H, and I. For the
position of the reversing switch shown
by the full lines, J is connected to G
and K to H. When the switch is
thrown to the right-hand position, as
shown by the dotted lines, J is connected
to H and K to I. It is obvious
that the direction of the current
through the armature B will be reversed
when the reversing switch is
thrown from one position to the other.
The direction in which the armature
rotates will change, due to the reversal
in direction of the current through it.
The same results could be obtained by
reversing the current in the field winding
A. But it must always be borne in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_379' name='Page_379' href='#Page_379'>[379]</a></span>
mind that in order to reverse the direction
of rotation, the current must be
reversed in the armature only or in the
field only, not in both.
</p>

<p>
The above switch may be constructed
as follows: First, procure a
piece of well-seasoned hard wood, say
maple, 1/2&nbsp;in. thick, 2-1/2&nbsp;in. wide and 4&nbsp;in. long. Round off the corners and
the edges of this piece on one side and
drill the holes indicated in the sketch.
The four corner holes should be of
such a size as to accommodate the
screws used in mounting four small
back-connected binding posts. The
remaining holes should be 1/8&nbsp;in. All
these holes should be countersunk
with a 3/8-in. bit to a depth of 1/4&nbsp;in. on
the under side.
</p>

<p>
Cut from some 1/16-in. sheet brass
two pieces, 2-3/4&nbsp;in. long, 1/2&nbsp;in. wide at
one end and 1/4&nbsp;in. at the other, and
round their ends. Drill a 1/8-in. hole
through the larger end of each of
these pieces, 1/4&nbsp;in. from the end, and
also a hole through each, 1-1/4&nbsp;in. from
the narrow end. The last two holes
should be threaded for 1/8-in. machine
screws. Obtain five 1/8-in. brass bolts,
1/2&nbsp;in. long. File the heads of three of
these bolts down to a thickness of approximately
1/16&nbsp;in. and mount them in
the holes G, H and I. Before mounting
anything on the base the grooves
indicated by the heavy dotted lines
should be cut in the under side so that
the various points may be properly
connected by conductors placed in the
grooves. Now mount the two pieces
of sheet brass upon the base by means
of the remaining two bolts, which
should pass through the holes J and K.
A 1/16-in. washer should be placed between
the pieces of brass and the
wooden base.
</p>

<p>
Procure a piece of 1/8-in. fiber, 1-1/4&nbsp;in. long and 3/8&nbsp;in. broad. Drill two
1/8-in. holes in this piece, one in each
end, so that they are 1&nbsp;in. apart. Drill
a third 1/8-in. hole in the center and
fasten a small handle to the piece of
fiber. Now mount this piece upon the
two pieces of brass that form the
blades of the switch by means of two
small 1/8-in. brass machine screws.
</p>

<p>
Two small brads should be driven
into the wooden base so as to prevent
the possibility of the switch blades
moving beyond their proper position.
Two pieces of 1/16-in. fiber should be
placed between the heads of the screws
G and H, and H and I, to prevent the
ends of the switch blades from dropping
down on the wooden base.

A Simple Sextant
</h2>


<p>
A sextant for measuring the latitude
of any place can be easily constructed
as follows: While a board, 1&nbsp;in. thick,
6&nbsp;in. wide, and 12&nbsp;in. long is about right
for the instrument, any dimensions
can be used, providing the line AB
is at perfect right angles to the level
of the sights C and D. The sights are
better to use, although the upper edge
of the board, if it is perfectly straight,
will do as well. If it is desired to use
sights, a slight groove is cut in the upper
edge; a V-shaped piece, cut from
tin, is fastened at one end, and a small
pointed nail is driven in at the other.
In doing this, be sure to level the
bottom of the V-notch and nail point
so that in drawing the line AB it will
be at perfect right angles to a line between
the sights. A tack is driven into
the side of the board at the upper edge,
a line fastened to it and a weight tied
to the lower end which should swing
below the lower edge of the board.

How to Make a Taper Ferrule
</h2>


<p>
Having occasion to make a taper
ferrule of irregular form, a pattern from
which to cut the material was made as
follows: A mandrel of the desired
shape was made, a piece of writing
paper, soaked in water, wrapped around
the mandrel, and a piece of twine
wound over it, coil after coil like the
thread on a spool. This was allowed
to dry thoroughly, using a little heat.
The string was then removed and a
longitudinal cut made in the paper
while on the mandrel. When opened
this paper formed the pattern.
</p>

<p>
A piece of metal was cut from the
pattern and the edges were brought together
and brazed with spelter. The
point of the mandrel was driven
through a piece of block tin, about 1/2&nbsp;in. thick. The mandrel was then removed,
the ferrule was placed on it, and
both then started in the hole made in
the tin and driven through it. As the
mandrel with the ferrule passed
through the tin, the metal was shaped
exactly to the mandrel. It is best to
oil the hole in the tin slightly. Tin is
preferable as it is harder.&mdash;Contributed

The bell shown in the accompanying

usefulness in connection with burglar
alarms, door-bell signals, telephone signals,

there is a circuit controlled by the
armature of the bell, which is normally
open, but becomes closed as soon as
the armature is drawn over. The closing
of this circuit by the operation of
the armature amounts to keeping the
push button in the bell circuit depressed,
and the bell will continue to
ring until the latch A is restored by
pulling the cord B.

  <p>An Ordinary Vibrating Bell Used as a Continuously
Ringing Bell, and the Wiring Diagram</p>
</div>

<p>
Any ordinary vibrating bell may be
converted into a continuously ringing
bell as follows: In the armature, C,
mount a short metal pin, D, and round
off its under side slightly. A latch, A,
should now be constructed similar to
the one shown in the sketch and
mounted in such a position that its left
end will rest on the outer end of the pin
D when the armature, C, of the bell is
in its extreme outer position. The
length of the latch should be such that
its left end will drop off the end of the
pin D, due to the action of the spring
E, when the armature C is drawn over
by the electromagnets F, thus allowing
it to come into contact with a spring
G, which is electrically connected to
the terminal of the bell marked H.
The latch A is connected to one side of
the line, as shown in the sketch, so
as to include the bell winding and
battery in a local circuit that is formed
by the latch coming in contact with the
spring G. The end of the latch should
not interfere with the free operation
of the armature when it is resting on
the spring G. A cord, B, attached to
the outer end of the latch, is used
in restoring it, and at the same time
stopping the bell from ringing. The
tension in the spring E should be so
adjusted that the operation of the latch
is sure and firm, yet not too stiff.

Renewing Dry Batteries
</h2>


<p>
It is a well-known fact that dry cells
commence to deteriorate from the time
they are manufactured, and it is a matter
of considerable uncertainty in purchasing
cells to know whether they
will continue to be efficient for their
supposed natural life under the existing
conditions of service, or for only
a small part of this period. When the
voltage of a dry cell falls below a certain
value it is usually discarded and
replaced by a new one, which often
means quite an expense. The following
simple suggestion will enable one
to renew the prematurely exhausted
cell with very little trouble and slight
expense, so that its period of usefulness
will be extended for a length of
time, at least
equal to that for
which it could be
used if put into
service immediately
after its
manufacture.

case, having
inside dimensions
a little greater than the zinc cup.
The space between the zinc cup and
case is filled with a dry electrolyte,
which, upon the addition of moisture,
sets up a chemical action with the
exterior surface of the zinc, and the
latter having been perforated, causes
electrical action to be again produced.
</p>

<p>
The casing, or cup, to be used outside
the zinc cup should be made of a
waterproof material. The electrolyte
instead of being placed between this
cup and the zinc in a powdered form, as
might be expected, should be held by
several layers of blotting paper, formed
into a cylinder of the proper diameter
to fit snugly on the outside of the zinc
cup. This porous cup should be impregnated
with a solution containing
the following materials in the approximate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_383' name='Page_383' href='#Page_383'>[383]</a></span>
amounts given: Muriate of ammonia,
10 parts; bichromate of potash,
4 parts, and chloride of sodium, 4
parts. After the porous cup has thoroughly
soaked in the above solution
it should be dried by passing a roller
over its external surface when it is
mounted on a wooden cylinder of
proper diameter. The moisture-proof
cup may be formed outside the porous
cup by covering the latter with several
coats of waterproofing paste and winding
on several thicknesses of common
manila paper, each layer of paper being
treated with the paste. A disk of
cardboard, properly treated, should be
placed in the end of the cylinder to
form the bottom, and the edge of the
manila paper folded in over it and
pasted in place.
</p>

<p>
The pasteboard covering surrounding
the zinc cup of the cell should be
removed and the surface of the zinc
thoroughly cleaned. The coal tar in
the top of the zinc cup should be removed
by tapping around the edge with
a hammer, and a large number of small
holes should be made in the walls of
the cup with a sharp instrument. Then
put the cell within the porous cup and
fill the top with clear water, preferably
rain water. A chemical reaction will
immediately take place between the
outer surface of the zinc and the chemicals
contained in the material forming
the porous cup, and the terminal voltage
of the cell will be practically the
same as it was when the cell was new.
The water, of course, must be replenished
from time to time on account of
evaporation, and the useful life of the
cell can be prolonged for a considerable
time. A part cross section of a
cell treated as described above is shown
in the accompanying sketch.

Workbench Equipment for a Table Top
</h2>


<p>
The average home mechanic with a
few tools seldom has a place to work
and is usually without a workbench.
As this was my case, I constructed a
bench equipment that I could easily
clamp to the kitchen or other table and
thus have the necessary tools at hand
for work. A plank, 2&nbsp;in. thick, 10&nbsp;in.
wide and 18&nbsp;in. long, was planed and
smoothed up on all sides, and a vise
and a bench pin were fastened on one edge.

To the under side of the same edge
two blocks were securely fastened, as

pieces were fastened with hinges. With
a bolt, running through from the top,
and a thumb nut used underneath,
these pieces are used as clamps for
holding the bench to the table top.
The top can be removed and set away in
a closet when not in use.&mdash;Contributed

<p>
The guide shown is nonbinding and
has been found thoroughly practical
after several years' use on furniture.
The guide A
consists of a
piece of wood,
about 1-1/8&nbsp;in.
square, with a
concave cut in
its upper edge,
the width being
about 3/4&nbsp;in.
and the depth
such as not to
cut through the
extending end
projecting over
the crossbar B.
The drawer sides have a half-round
edge on the bottom edge to run in the
groove in the guide. The difference
in width between the groove in the
guide and the rounding edge on the
drawer side causes the drawer always
to ride snugly without binding as
the wood expands or contracts with
changes in the weather.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
An Electric Shaving Mug
</h2>


<p>
The general use of electricity in the
home has opened up a new field in the
way of heating and cooking utensils.
While these utensils are sold by electric-supply
houses, some of them can
be easily made at home and answer
the purpose just as nicely. One of
these is the electric shaving mug.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img385f15'>

  <p>Detail of the Parts for the Construction of an
Electric Shaving Mug. The Heating of Sufficient Water for
a Shave can be Accomplished at a Nominal Cost (Fig.&nbsp;1, Fig.&nbsp;2, Fig.&nbsp;3, Fig.&nbsp;4, Fig.&nbsp;5)</p>
</div>

<p>
A mug that will stand heat is the
first thing required, and an aluminum
cup of standard shape and design,
which can be bought in almost every
town, will do perfectly well. These
cups are spun from a flat sheet and
have no seams to open and leak, and
it is necessary that no holes be drilled
in the cup as it is impossible to make
such a hole watertight. The heating
element must be fastened to the mug
with a clamp. The clamp will also
allow the heating coil to be removed
for repairs without injury to the mug.
The bottoms of these mugs have a
flange which makes a recessed part
and in this the heating element is placed.
</p>

<p>
The legs of the mug are made of
sheet brass as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1, one of
the three having an enlargement near
its center with a hole for an insulating
button (Fig.&nbsp;2), of "transite" or some
other material, to hold the supply cord
in place.
</p>

<p>
The clamp for holding the heating
coil in place is shown in Fig.&nbsp;3. This
clamp has a screw in the center to
tighten it in place. The legs and
clamp may be nickelplated if desired.
</p>

<p>
The heating coil is shown in Fig.&nbsp;4
which is a coil of flat "Nichrome"
wire, or ribbon as it is called, 12&nbsp;ft.
long, 1/16&nbsp;in. wide and 3/1000&nbsp;in. thick.
This is equal in cross section to a No.
26 gauge wire. To wind this coil, procure
a block of wood, 7/8&nbsp;in. thick and
about 4&nbsp;in. square, with a 1/2-in. hole in
the center for an axis or pivot. Clamp
a 1/2-in. rod in a vise so that the block
can be rotated about it. Begin at the
center and fasten one end of the ribbon
to the block, leaving about 2&nbsp;in.
projecting for a connection, then proceed
to wind the ribbon in a spiral coil,
separating each turn from the preceding
one with a strand of asbestos cord.
A small section of the coil is shown in
Fig.&nbsp;5, in which A, or the light part,
represents the asbestos insulation, and
B, or the black lines, the heating element.
The insulation may be obtained
by untwisting some 1/8-in. round asbestos
packing and using one of the
strands. This cord insulates each
turn of the ribbon from the other and
the current must travel through the
whole coil without jumping across
from one turn to the other. The
whole coil must be closely wound to
get it into the limited space at the bottom
of the mug.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_386' name='Page_386' href='#Page_386'>[386]</a></span>
Before taking the coil from the
block, rub into its surface a little asbestos
retort cement, or a cement composed
of a mixture of silicate of soda
and silica, or glass sand. This mixture,
when dry, will tend to hold the
coil together and the current may be
passed through the coil to test it as
well as to bake it in its coiled shape.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img385f67'>
  <img src='images/img385f67.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>(Fig.&nbsp;6, Fig.&nbsp;7)</p>
</div>


<p>
The support for the heating coil is
made of a piece of 5/16-in. asbestos
wood or transite. Cut it to fit into the
recessed bottom of the mug, then with
a chisel remove the material in the top
to form a depression 1/16&nbsp;in. deep to receive
the coil with its top flush. The
leads of the coil are run through the
disk. The surface of the coil is then
plastered evenly with retort cement.
The legs are fastened to a second piece
of insulating material with round-head
brass machine screws, 1/2&nbsp;in. long,
with nuts. The heads of these screws
are shown in Fig.&nbsp;6, the nuts being
above the brass and between the two
insulating pieces.
</p>

<p>
The ends of the heating ribbon are
brought through the lower insulating
disk and attached to binding posts as
shown. The leads may be covered
with tape to prevent any short circuit.
</p>

<p>
The mug uses 3-1/2 amperes at 110
volts, either direct or alternating current,
and it will cost about 3 cents an
hour to operate it. Care should be
taken to use a separable attachment
for connecting, as an ordinary lamp
socket may be burned out by turning
off the current, it being adapted only
to a small capacity.
</p>

<p>
In assembling the parts, several
pieces of mica should be placed between
the coil and the metal of the
mug to insulate the coil from the mug.

The pickpocket finds it easy to unsnap
a handbag and remove some
of the contents,
especially in
crowded places.
To make it less
easy for the pickpocket,
I fixed
my mother's
handbag as
shown in the
sketch. I used a
chain which had
served its day
holding a small
coin purse&mdash;any small chain will do&mdash;by
passing it through the links that
hold the handle and winding it once or
twice around the snap fasteners to hold
them securely closed.
</p>

<p>
The chain may be either shortened
enough to make it convenient to hold
with the handle of the handbag, or may
be left long and used over the shoulder
under the coat, thus making it possible
to have both hands free for shopping
while the handbag hangs by the side.
This leaves a person free from the
worry of taking care that the bag is
not laid down somewhere and lost.
The bag may be easily opened by unwinding
the chain after loosening it by
raising the bag slightly.&mdash;Contributed

Emery cloth in sheets is very easily
spoiled around a workbench. Oil or
other fluids used on work are apt to
drop on it and when wet for a short
time the abrasive is useless. The illustration
shows a tin holder, A, that
can be placed on the under side of the
bench where space is not required for
drawer room.

<h2>
The Operation of the Compass
</h2>


<p>
After trying to tell a few small boys
what a compass is, they wanted a
practical illustration&mdash;something they
could see. Not having a compass or
knowing where to locate one handily,
I used a piece of cork with needles and
a needle for a pivot and found it very
satisfactory. The method used is
shown in the sketch.
</p>

<p>
It is best not to magnetize both
needles unless care is exercised in
maintaining pole relationship, or they
will oppose each other and not point
to the north. The extreme ends or the
heads of the needles must be opposites,
the head of one negative and the head
of the other positive.

<p>
If a good compass is brought carelessly
in contact with a magnet, the
poles may become reversed and the
north end will no longer point to the
north but to the south until the current
has been reversed again by bringing
the opposite pole of the magnet in
contact with the compass.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
How to Construct a Simple Galvanometer
</h2>


<p>
A galvanometer is an instrument
used to detect the presence of an electrical
current in a circuit or to measure
the value of the current in amperes.
The operation of practically all
galvanometers is based upon the same
principle, and they differ chiefly in
mechanical construction and the relative
arrangement of their different parts.
</p>

<p>
A very simple galvanometer, that
will give quite satisfactory results, under
favorable conditions, may be constructed
as follows: Turn from a piece
of hard wood a ring having dimensions
corresponding to those given in
the cross section, Fig.&nbsp;1. Fill the
groove in this ring to within 1/8&nbsp;in. of
the top with No. 18 gauge double-cotton-covered
copper wire, insulating the
different layers from each other by
means of a layer of good bond paper.
The winding may be started by drilling
a small hole through the side of
the groove, as close to the bottom as
possible, and allowing about 6&nbsp;in. of
the wire to protrude through it. The
outside end may be terminated in a
similar manner, and the two ends
should be on the same side of the ring,
or as near each other as possible. A
protecting covering of bookbinder's
paper is placed over the winding and
the completed ring given a coat of
shellac. The electric current to be detected
or measured is to pass around
the winding of this coil and produce an
effect upon a compass needle mounted
in its center. In order that the current
may produce a maximum effect
upon the needle, the coil should be
mounted in a vertical position.

  <p>The Wood Ring for the Coil
and Its Holding Stirrup (Fig.&nbsp;1, Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
The base upon which the ring is
to be mounted may be cut from some
1/2-in. hard wood. It should be circular
in form and about 5&nbsp;in. in diameter,
and have its upper edge rounded
off and shellacked to improve its appearance.
The ring is mounted in a
vertical position on this base, which
may be done as follows: Cut a flat
surface on each of the flanges of the
ring so that it will stand in a vertical
position and the terminals of the winding
will be as near as possible to the
surface upon which
the ring rests.
Then form a stirrup
from some thin
sheet brass, similar
to that shown in
Fig.&nbsp;2, so that it will fit tightly over
the ring and its outwardly projecting
ends will rest upon the base of the
instrument. Small wood screws are
used in fastening the stirrup to the
base. The fastening may be made
more secure by cutting a groove across
the inside of the ring for the stirrup
to fit in, Fig.&nbsp;3, thus preventing the
possibility of the ring moving through
the stirrup. Two holes should be
drilled in the base for the terminals of
the winding to pass through, and it
would be best to cut two grooves in
the side of the ring for these wires so
as to prevent their coming into contact
with the metal stirrup. Two back-connected
binding posts, A and B, Fig.
3, are mounted on the base and the
ends of the winding attached to them.
The wires should be placed in grooves
cut in the under side of the base, and
the screws used in fastening the binding
posts should be countersunk.

<p>
A short compass needle is then
mounted on a suitable supporting pivot
in the center of the coil. This compass
needle will always come to rest
in an approximate north and south
position when it is acted upon by the
earth's magnetic field alone. If now
the plane of the coil be placed in such
a position that it is parallel to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_390' name='Page_390' href='#Page_390'>[390]</a></span>
direction of the compass needle (no current
in the coil), the magnetic field that
will be produced when a current is sent
through the winding will be perpendicular
to the magnetic field of the earth
and there will be a force, due to this
particular current, tending to turn the
compass needle around perpendicularly
to its original position. There will be
a deflection of the needle for all values
of current in the coil, and this deflection
will vary in value as the current
in the coil varies. The mere fact that
the compass needle is deflected due to
a current in the coil gives a means of
detecting a current in any circuit of
which the coil is a part, and the degree
of this deflection affords a means
of measuring the current, the value of
the different deflections in terms of
the current in the coil having been experimentally
determined by sending a
known current through the coil and
noting the positions of the compass
needle for each value of current used.
</p>

<p>
In order to determine the deflection
of the needle, a scale, C, Fig.&nbsp;3, must
be mounted directly under the compass
needle and a pointer, D, attached
to the compass needle so that any
movement of the needle results in an
equal angular displacement of the
pointer. The compass needle, E,
should be short and quite heavy, say,
5/8&nbsp;in. in length, 1/16&nbsp;in. in thickness and
1/4&nbsp;in. in width at its center, and tapering
to a point at its ends. It should
be made of a good grade of steel, tempered
and then magnetized by means
of a powerful electromagnet. The
reason for making the compass needle
short is that it will then operate in
practically a uniform magnetic field,
which exists only at the center of the
coil. On account of the needle being
so short and in view of the fact that
it comes to rest parallel to the coil for
its zero position, it is best to use a
pointer attached to the needle to determine
its deflection, as this pointer can
be made much longer than the needle,
and any movement of the needle may
be more easily detected, as the end of
the pointer moves through a much
larger distance than the end of the
needle, and since it may be attached to
the needle, at right angles to the
needle's axis, the end of the pointer
will be off to one side of the coil and
its movement may be easily observed.
The pointer should be made of some
nonmagnetic material, such as aluminum
or brass, and it should be as long
as it may be conveniently made. A
suitable box with a glass cover may be
provided in which the needle, pointer
and scale may be housed. The construction
of this box will be left entirely
to the ingenuity of the one making
the instrument.

  <p>The Electric Circuit, Showing Connections for Finding
the Value of a Current in Calibrating (Fig.&nbsp;4)</p>
</div>

<p>
In order to use this instrument as
an ammeter, it will be necessary to
calibrate it, which consists in determining
the position of the pointer for
various values of current through the
coil. It will be necessary to obtain
the use of a direct-current ammeter for
this purpose. The winding of the galvanometer,
ammeter, battery and a
variable resistance of some kind should
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_391' name='Page_391' href='#Page_391'>[391]</a></span>
all be connected in series as shown in
the diagram, Fig.&nbsp;4. Allow the compass
needle to come to rest under the
influence of the earth's magnetic field
and then turn the coil into such a position
that it is as nearly parallel with
the needle as possible. This corresponds
to the zero position, and the
instrument must always be in this position
when it is used. The position of
the ends of the pointer is now marked
on the scale for different values of current,
first with the current in one direction
and then in the opposite direction.
The deflection of the needle will,
of course, reverse when the current is reversed.
</p>

<p>
The effect produced by any current
upon the compass needle can be
changed by changing the number of
turns in the coil. In measuring a large
current, a few turns of large wire
would be required, and in measuring
a small current, a large number of
turns of small wire could be used. In
other words, the size of the wire will
depend upon the current it is to carry
and the number of turns in the coil will
depend upon the magnetic effect the
current is to produce, which is proportional
to the product of the number of
turns and the current, called the ampere-turns.

<h2>
How to Make a Small Rheostat
</h2>


<p>
In operating small motors there is as
a rule no means provided for regulating
their speed, and this often is quite
a disadvantage, especially in the case
of toy motors such as used on miniature
electric locomotives. The speed,
of course, can be regulated by changing
the number of cells of battery by
means of a special switch, but then all
the cells are not used the same amount
and some of them may be completely
exhausted before the others show any
appreciable depreciation. If a small
transformer is used with a number of
taps taken off the secondary winding,
the voltage impressed upon the motor,
and consequently the speed, can be
changed by varying the amount of the
secondary winding across which the
motor is connected.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img393a'>

  alt=''
  />
  <p>Diagram Showing the Connections for a Small
Motor Where a Rheostat Is in the Line (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
But in both these cases there is no
means of varying the speed gradually.
This can, however, be accomplished by
means of a small rheostat placed in
series with the motor. The rheostat
acts in an electrical circuit in just the
same way a valve does in a hydraulic
circuit. It consists of a resistance,
which can be easily varied in value,
placed in the circuit connecting the
motor with the source of electrical
energy. A diagram of the rheostat is
shown in Fig.&nbsp;1, in which A represents
the armature of the motor; B, the field;
C, the rheostat, and D, the source of
electrical energy. When the handle
E is in such a position that the maximum
amount of resistance is in circuit
there will be a minimum current
through the field and armature of the
motor, and its speed will be a minimum.
As the resistance of the rheostat
is decreased, the current increases
and the motor speeds up, reaching a
maximum value when the resistance of
the rheostat has been reduced to zero
value. Such a rheostat may be used
in combination with a special switch
F., as shown in. Fig.&nbsp;2. The switch
gives a means of varying the voltage
and the rheostat takes care of the desired
changes in speed occurring between
those produced by the variations
in voltage.

  <p>Diagram of a Small Motor Where a Rheostat and
Switch Are in the Line (Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
A very simple and inexpensive rheostat
may be constructed as follows:
Procure a piece of thin fiber, about 1/16&nbsp;in. thick, 1/2&nbsp;in. wide and approximately
10&nbsp;in. long. Wind on this piece of
fiber, after the edges have all been
smoothed down, a piece of No. 22
gauge cotton-covered resistance wire,
starting about 1/4&nbsp;in. from one end and
winding the various turns fairly close
together to within 1/4&nbsp;in. of the other
end. The ends of the wire may be
secured by passing them through several
small holes drilled in the piece of
fiber, and should protrude 3 or 4&nbsp;in. for
connecting to binding posts that will
be mounted upon the base of the rheostat.
</p>

<p>
Now form this piece of fiber into a
complete ring by bending it around
some round object, the flat side being
toward the object. Determine as accurately
as possible the diameter of
the ring thus formed and also its thickness.
Obtain a piece of well seasoned
hard wood, 1/2&nbsp;in. thick and 4-1/2&nbsp;in.
square. Round off the corners and
upper edges of this block and mark
out on it two circles whose diameters
correspond to the inside and outside
diameters of the fiber ring. The centers
of these circles should be in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_394' name='Page_394' href='#Page_394'>[394]</a></span>
center of the block. Carefully saw out
the two circles so that the space between
the inside and outside portions
will just accommodate the fiber ring.
Obtain a second piece of hard wood,
1/4&nbsp;in. thick and 4-3/4&nbsp;in. square, round
off its corners and upper edges and
mount the other pieces upon it by
means of several small wood screws,
which should pass up from the under
side and be well countersunk. Place
the fiber ring in the groove, but, before
doing so, drill a hole in the base proper
for one end of the wire to pass through.
Two small back-connected binding
posts should be mounted in the corners.
One of these should be connected
to the end of the winding and
the other to a small bolt in the center
of the base that serves to hold the handle
or movable arm of the rheostat in
place. These connecting leads should
all be placed in grooves cut in the
under side of the base.

sheet brass, and should have the
following approximate dimensions:
length, 2&nbsp;in.; breadth 1/2&nbsp;in. at one end,
and 1/4&nbsp;in. at the other. Obtain a 1/8-in.
brass bolt, about 1&nbsp;in. long, also several
washers. Drill a hole in the larger end
of the piece of brass to accommodate
the bolt and also in the center of the
wooden base. Countersink the hole in
the base on the under side with a 1/2-in.
bit to a depth of 1/4&nbsp;in. On the under
side of the piece of brass, and near its
narrow end, solder a piece of thin
spring brass so that its free end will
rest upon the upper edge of the fiber
ring. A small handle may be mounted
upon the upper side of the movable
arm. Now mount the arm on the base
by means of the bolt, placing several
washers between it and the upper
surface of the base, so that its outer
end will be raised above the edge
of the fiber ring. Solder a short piece
of thin brass to the nut that is to
be placed on the lower end of the
bolt, and cut a recess in the countersunk
portion of the hole in the base to
accommodate it. When the bolt has
been screwed down sufficiently tight
a locknut may be put on, or the first
nut soldered to the end of the bolt.
If possible, it would be best to use a
spring washer, or two, between the
arm and base.
</p>

<p>
The insulation should now be removed
from the wire on the upper
edge of the fiber ring with a piece of
fine sandpaper, so that the spring on
the under side of the movable arm
may make contact with the winding.
The rheostat is now complete with the
exception of a coat of shellac. A cross-sectional
view of the completed rheostat
is shown in Fig.&nbsp;3.

Buttons on gates or small doors are
apt to become loose and then drop
down, thereby allowing
the gate

A Compensating Siphon
</h2>


<p>
The homemade siphon shown in the
sketch consists of two rubber corks
and a glass tube with a rubber hose
connected to it. The cork A is used
as a bearing and support on the edge
of the tank. The position of the cork
B on the tube determines the distance
that the mouth of the tube will be under
the surface of the liquid, also to
some extent the sensitiveness of the
apparatus. However, the principle of
the device is the buoyant effect of the
water and the lever action of the rubber
tube which is attached.

about 1/10 of a pound. The practical
application of this siphon will be found
in sieve tests where it is necessary to
collect the residue on the bottom of
the tank while drawing off the liquid

<h2>
A Polarity Indicator

<p>
Lines in a cable or the ends of connections
at a distance from the battery
must be tested to determine the polarity.
Where a large amount of this
work is to be done, as in automobile
and motorboat repairing, it is necessary
to have an indicator to save time. A
cheap indicator for this purpose can
be made of a 6-in. test tube having its
ends sealed and inclosing a saturated
solution of ammonium chloride (sal
ammoniac) and water. The sealed
ends are made by inserting a piece of
wire through a cork and, after forcing
this tightly into the end of the test
tube, covering it with sealing wax.

Small Steam-Engine Cylinders Made from Seamless Brass Tubing
</h2>


<p>
In making a small steam engine it
was desired to use seamless brass tubing
for the cylinders. To have them
exactly alike a piece of tubing of the
right size and of sufficient length for
both cylinders was fitted on a wood
mandrel, A, and the ends trued up in a
lathe. As these cylinders were to fit
into holes bored in a steel bedplate, it
was necessary to have a flange at one
end. A groove was turned in the tubing
B in the center, and as a final operation
a parting tool was used on the
line CD. This resulted in a pair of
cylinders flanged to fit the bedplate.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
A Pocket Direct-Current Voltmeter
</h2>


<p>
The assembled drawings of a very
simple voltmeter are shown in Fig.&nbsp;1,
and its operation is as follows: The
moving portion consists of a pointer,
or needle, A; a small permanent magnet,
or armature, B, and a counterweight,
C, mounted upon a small steel
shaft, D. The ends of this steel shaft
are pointed and rest in bearings provided
in the U-shaped piece of brass
E, which is rigidly fastened to the fiber
base F, by means of two screws. The
permanent magnet B, carried on the
shaft D, is at all times under the magnetic
influence of the permanent horseshoe
magnet, G, which is fastened, by
means of thin brass straps, H H, and
small screws, to the base F, so that
the ends of the armature B are directly
above the poles of the horseshoe
magnet. The armature B will assume
the position shown in the sketch when
it is acted upon by the permanent
magnet G alone and the moving system
is perfectly balanced. A solenoid,
J, is mounted in the position shown.
When there is a current in its winding
its soft-iron core will become magnetized
and the magnetic pole produced
at the lower end will produce a magnetic
force upon the armature B, with
the result that the armature will be
rotated either in a clockwise or
counter-clockwise direction, depending
upon its polarity and the polarity of
the end of the core adjacent to it. Thus,
if the left end of the armature has north
polarity, the right end south polarity,
and the lower end of the core is magnetized
to a south polarity the armature
will be rotated clockwise, for the
left end, or north pole, will be attracted
by the lower end of the iron core, which
is a south pole, and the right end will
be repelled. This is in accordance with
one of the fundamental laws of magnetism
which states that magnetic poles
of unlike polarity attract each other
and those of like polarity repel each
other. The amount the armature B is
rotated will depend upon the relative
effects of the pole of the solenoid and
the permanent magnet G. The strength
of the pole of the solenoid will depend
upon the current in its winding and
the number of times the current passes
around the core, or the number of turns
in the winding. In other words, the
strength of the pole of the solenoid
varies as the product of the current and
the number of turns, which is called
the ampere-turns. The same magnetic
effect can be produced by a large current
passing through a few turns or a
small current passing through a relatively
large number of turns. This
simple relation of current and turns
gives a means of adjusting the current
capacity of the instrument so that a
full-scale deflection of the needle will
correspond to any desired maximum
current. The instrument may be used
as either a voltmeter or as an ammeter,
and its operation will be identical in
each case. The resistance of the voltmeter,
however, will be many times the
resistance of the ammeter, as it will
be connected directly across the line,
while the ammeter will always be in
series in the circuit in which it is desired
to measure the current. The
following description and suggestion as
to how to proceed in the construction
of this instrument may be useful to
those who undertake to build one. All
the minor details and some of the dimensions
will be omitted in the description,
but these can be easily supplied.

  <p>The Parts as They are Assembled to Make a Pocket
Voltmeter for Direct Currents (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
Procure a piece of hard rubber or
fiber, about 1/4&nbsp;in. in thickness and of
sufficient size to cut from it a disk, 2-1/2
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_398' name='Page_398' href='#Page_398'>[398]</a></span>
in. in diameter. Make a small horseshoe
magnet from a piece of the very
best steel obtainable, and magnetize it
to as high a strength as possible. This
magnet is made of a piece of steel, 1/8&nbsp;in. thick, about 3/8&nbsp;in. in breadth, and
of such length that the overall lengthwise
dimension of the completed magnet
will be about 1-7/8&nbsp;in. and the distance
between the inside edges of the
ends a little greater than 1/2&nbsp;in. Fasten
the completed magnet to the base F
by means of two or three straps, made
from some thin brass, and small machine
or wood screws.
</p>

<p>
Then cut from some 1/16-in. sheet
brass a piece having the general appearance
and dimensions shown at A,
Fig.&nbsp;2. Bend the ends of this piece
over at right angles to the center portion
along the dotted lines. Drill the
hole at the upper end and thread it
for a 1/16-in. machine screw. By means
of a pointed drill, make a small recess
at the lower end directly opposite the
first hole. This small recess is to form
the lower bearing for the shaft supporting
the moving system, while a
small recess cut centrally in the end of
a screw, mounted in the upper hole,
will form the upper bearing. The screw
placed in the upper hole need be only
about 3/16&nbsp;in. long. The holes in the
two wings are for mounting this piece
upon the fiber base, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1.
</p>

<p>
The shaft for supporting the moving
system is made of a piece of a hatpin.
It is about 13/16&nbsp;in. long and its ends are
pointed so that they will turn freely
in the bearings provided for them.
</p>

<p>
The armature is cut from a piece
of 1/16-in. sheet steel. It is made about
3/4&nbsp;in. long, 5/16&nbsp;in. wide at the center,
tapering to 1/8&nbsp;in. at the ends. A hole
is drilled in its center so that it may
be forced onto the shaft. It is mounted
so that its lower surface comes about
1/4&nbsp;in. from the lower end of the shaft.
</p>

<p>
Then cut from some very thin brass
a piece, that is to form the needle, 1/4&nbsp;in. wide at one end and tapered to a
point at the other, the total length
being about 3&nbsp;in. Drill a hole in the
large end of this piece, the same size
as the shaft and 1/2&nbsp;in. from the end.
This piece is not fastened to the shaft
until some of the other parts are completed.

  <p>Details of the Supports for the Coil and for the
Needle, or Pointer, Shaft (Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
The spool upon which the winding
is to be placed is made as follows:
Procure a piece of very soft wrought
iron, 1-1/4&nbsp;in. long and 1/4&nbsp;in. in diameter,
to form the core. The ends of
the spool are made of thin brass and
are dimensioned as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2,
at B and C. The piece shown at B
is to form the lower end of the spool,
and is bent at right angles along the
dotted line. The two holes at the lower
edge are for attaching the end of the
spool to the fiber base. The piece shown
at C forms the upper end of the spool
and at the same time a back upon
which the scale of the instrument is
mounted. The holes in the lower edge
are threaded for small machine screws,
as it will be necessary to fasten this
piece to the base by means of screws
that pass through the base from the
under side, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. Bend
the upper and lower portion of the
piece over at right angles to the center
portion along the dotted lines. Make
sure that the large hole in the center
of each end piece is of such size that
it will fit very tight on the end of the
wrought-iron core. Force the end
pieces onto the ends of the core a short
distance, say, 1/16&nbsp;in., and hammer down
the edges of the core so that the end
pieces cannot be easily removed. In
fastening the ends to the core be sure
that the parts that are to rest upon the
base are parallel with each other and
extend in opposite directions; also that
the ends are at right angles to the
core. Then insulate the inner portions
of the completed spool with several
thicknesses of onion-skin paper, or any
good-quality, thin writing paper, and
shellac. The winding will be described later.
</p>

<p>
Mount the spool and support for the
bearings upon the base so that they
occupy the positions, relative to each
other, indicated in Fig.&nbsp;1. A paper
scale is then mounted upon the brass
base provided for it by means of some
thin shellac. The upper and lower lines
for the scale can now be drawn upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_399' name='Page_399' href='#Page_399'>[399]</a></span>
the paper, using the center of the screw
at the lower end of the needle as a
center. These lines are best placed
about 1/8&nbsp;in. apart and not nearer the
edge of the base than 1/4&nbsp;inches.
</p>

<p>
The needle is bent over at right
angles 5/16&nbsp;in. from the center of the
shaft. Another right-angle bend in the
needle is then made so that the pointed
end will be about 1/16&nbsp;in. above the surface
of the scale when the large end
of the needle is fastened to the shaft
3/8&nbsp;in. from the upper end of the latter.
Turn the needle on the shaft so that
the pointer is at the left end of the
scale when the moving system is at
rest. The shaft must be exactly vertical
when this adjustment is made. Cut
the end of the needle down until its
end is midway between the two scale
lines. Solder the needle to the shaft,
and then place a sufficient quantity of
solder on the broad end to balance the
system perfectly and allow it to come
to rest in any position when the armature
B is not influenced by any magnetic field.
</p>

<p>
A containing case for the instrument
may be made as follows: Make a cylinder
from some thin sheet brass, having
exactly the same inside diameter
as the base, and a height a little greater
than the vertical distance from the
lower surface of the base to the upper
surface of the needle. Also a disk
from some thin sheet brass, having a
diameter 1/8&nbsp;in. greater than the outside
diameter of the cylinder. Round off
the edges of this disk and cut a curved
slot in it directly over the scale, about
3/8&nbsp;in. wide and of the same length and
form as the scale. Solder the disk to
one end of the cylinder, placing the
solder all on the inside. To prevent
moisture from entering the case, fasten
a piece of thin glass on the under side
of the slot in the disk by means of some
shellac and several pieces of brass soldered
to the disk and bent down onto
the glass. The case can now be fastened
to the base by means of several
screws, passing through its lower end
into the edge of the base. Two small
binding posts are mounted on the outside
of the case, about 90&nbsp;deg. apart
and well insulated from each other and
from the case, to serve as terminals for
the instrument.
</p>

<p>
The instrument is now complete
with the exception of the winding.
Since this is to be a voltmeter and it
is always desirable that a voltmeter
take as small a current as possible, the
winding must consist of a relatively
large number of turns of small wire,
each turn carrying a small current.
The difference in the construction of
different instruments necessitates that
their winding contain a different number
of turns in order that a given voltage
may produce a full-scale deflection.
A little experimenting with different
windings is the easiest means of determining
the proper size of wire and
number of turns to meet individual
requirements. After adjusting the
winding so that the maximum voltage
it is desired to measure produces a
full-scale deflection, the scale is calibrated
by marking the positions of the
needle in accordance with those of the
needle of a standard instrument connected
in parallel with it. In marking
the scale of an ammeter, connect the
instruments in series. Remember that
if the instrument is to be used as an
ammeter, it must have as low a resistance
as possible and that to prevent
undue heating, the wire must have
ample cross section.
</p>

<p>
If difficulty is experienced due to the
continuous vibration of the needle,
although the current be practically
constant, this trouble can be greatly
reduced by mounting a paper wind
vane on the moving system, which
will tend to dampen its movement.

<p>
Occasionally an amateur has need
of brass rings of round cross section,
and if their construction is not understood,
the task
is a difficult one.
If a piece of
brass tubing, an
old bushing or a
cored piece is at
hand, a part of
the work is already
done. If not, a piece of stock
with large enough outside diameter
should be chucked in the lathe and
drilled out with the right size of drill.
A tin or pasteboard template should
be prepared the size of the ring section&mdash;a
half circle is best, and it is
easiest made by drilling a hole in the
tin and cutting it in two. An inside
boring tool and a turning tool are
necessary. It is preferable to shape
the inside first, cutting it out roughly
and checking up with the template.
The amount of inside cutting is shown
in the drawing. A hard scraper and
emery cloth may be used for smoothing
and polishing.
</p>

<p>
Turn and polish the outside and
finally turn as far down on the inner
quarter as can be done without cutting
off the finish, then polish and cut it
off. It only requires a little filing to
smooth up the rim of rough metal left.

An Electric Fountain<br />
By Walter P. Butler

<p>
To make the grounds as attractive
as possible for a lawn party given one
night, I constructed an electric fountain
which at first appeared to be an
expensive proposition, but when completed
the desired effect was produced
without any expense whatever, as I
had the things used in its construction
on hand.

  <p>Details of the Different Parts to
Construct the Electric Fountain (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
A light frame, 9&nbsp;in. square, was
made, of 3/4-in. material, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;1, and a grooved pulley was attached
exactly in the center on the
under side of the crosspiece. A turned
stick, A, 2&nbsp;in. in diameter and 2-1/2&nbsp;in.
long, was fastened to the face of the
pulley so that it turned true as the
pulley and frame revolved. A hole
was then bored centrally through the
three parts, the frame crosspiece, the
pulley, and the turned stick, of a size
to fit a spindle about 3/8&nbsp;in. in diameter.
</p>

<p>
A box was procured, large enough
for the frame to turn in freely, and a
block of wood was fastened centrally
in its bottom, which had a 3/8-in. pin
set in a hole bored in the center. The
pin may be of hard wood, but it is
better to use metal. A bolt, or piece
of rod, will answer the purpose of a
pin very well.
</p>

<p>
A small battery motor&mdash;I had one
on hand and did not need to purchase
one&mdash;was fastened to one side of the
box so that its pulley was in line with
the pulley on the lower surface of the
frame. The batteries to run the motor
were placed in the corner of the box,
where the revolving frame would not
touch them. The motor may be of
larger current capacity, however, and
run direct on the current used for the lamps.

<p>
About 1/2&nbsp;in. from the lower end of
the turned piece A, a brass strip was
fastened around it. This work should
be neatly done, and the joint soldered
and smoothed, so that the outer surface
will not catch on the brush used
to make the contact. This ring can be
better made by cutting the width from
a piece of brass tubing of a size to fit
on the turned stick A. About 1-1/2&nbsp;in.
from the lower end four segments of a
circle were fastened so as to make a
space of about 1/4&nbsp;in. between their
ends. This construction is clearly
shown in Fig.&nbsp;2. A cross section,
showing the wire connections from
the brass ring and segments to the
lamps and where they lead out on top,
is shown at B. The contact brushes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_402' name='Page_402' href='#Page_402'>[402]</a></span>
consist of brass strips fastened with
bolts to an upright, C, made of wood
and attached to one edge of the block
in the bottom of the box. Two nuts
are used on each bolt, between which
are fastened the lead wires from a
source of current.

there are four. The wires E, from
each segment, are connected with

A glass plate was used to cover the
box, and a lawn spray of the fountain
type was placed on the glass. The
globes, as they light beneath the
spray, illuminate the top and the light
follows the streams of water so that
they appear like streams of light.
Each light is turned on in succession
as the frame revolves within the box,
and by using globes of different colors,
an exceedingly beautiful effect is obtained.
If the bared ends of the wires
are twisted together between the
globes, these will all glow at once.

<h2>
A Mystery Coin Box
</h2>


<p>
The effect of this trick is as follows:
A small metal box, just large enough
to hold a half dollar and about 1/2&nbsp;in.
high, with a cover that fits snugly over
the top, is passed out to be examined,
and when handed back to the performer
he places it on the finger ends
of his left hand, and a half dollar is
dropped into it and the cover put on.
The box is then shaken to prove that
the coin is still there. The performer
then taps the box with his fingers and
picks it up with the other hand and the
coin will appear to have fallen through
the bottom. Both the coin and box are
then handed out for examination.
</p>

<p>
This seemingly impossible effect is
made when the performer places the
cover on the box. The box is resting
on the fingers of the left hand and the
cover is held between the thumb and
forefinger of the right hand, but just
before placing the cover on, the box is
turned over with the right thumb, and
the cover is placed on the bottom instead
of the top.
</p>

<p>
The trick can be done within a foot
of the spectators without their seeing
the deception. It is a good plan to
hide the box with the right hand when
placing the cover, although this is not necessary.

<h2>
How to Make a Small Series Motor
</h2>


<p>
The motor here described has been
constructed and found to give very
good results. It is simple to build and
the materials required can be easily obtained.
The armature core and field,
or frame, are made of laminated iron,
instead of being cast as is often done
by the manufacturers, which is a decided
advantage, as certain losses are
thereby reduced, and its operation will
be improved by this type of construction
especially if used on an alternating-current circuit.
</p>

<p>
The machine will be divided into
three main parts, the construction of
each of which will be taken up in turn
and the method of procedure discussed
in detail. These parts are the completed
armature, the field and bearings,
and the brushes together with suitable
terminals and connections.
</p>

<p>
The armature core is constructed
from a number of pieces, having dimensions
that correspond to those given in
A, Fig.&nbsp;1. These pieces are cut from
thin annealed sheet iron, in sufficient
number to make a pile, 3/4&nbsp;in. high,
when placed on top of each other and
firmly clamped. It would, no doubt,
be best to first lay out one of these
pieces very carefully and then cut it
out and mark out the other pieces with
the first one as a pattern, being careful
to file off all the rough edges on each piece.

  <p>Details of the Armature Laminations and the Commutator
Segments, and the Method of Mounting
Armature Core and Commutator (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
Now obtain a piece of 1/4-in. iron or
brass rod, 3-1/4&nbsp;in. long, that is to serve
as a shaft upon which to mount the
armature and commutator. This rod
is threaded for a distance of 7/8&nbsp;in. on
one end and 1-7/8&nbsp;in. on the other.
Procure five brass nuts, 1/8&nbsp;in. thickness,
to fit the threads on the rod. If
possible have the ends of the rod centered
before the threads are cut, for
reasons to be given later. Place one
of the nuts on that end of the shaft
that is threaded for 7/8&nbsp;in., and in such
a position that its inner surface is 3/4&nbsp;in. from the end of the rod. Solder
this nut to the rod when it is in the
proper place and remove all extra solder.
Drill a 1/4-in. hole in each of the
armature stampings and place them on
the shaft, clamping them together with
three small clamps, one on each extension
or pole. Then place a second
nut on the shaft and draw it up tight
against the last stamping placed in
position, and solder it to the shaft.
Next wind two or three layers of good
strong tape around each of the rectangular
portions of the armature and
then remove the clamps. Make sure
that all the edges of the different laminations
are perfectly even before applying the tape.
</p>

<p>
The shaft is then placed between
two centers to determine whether the
core is approximately balanced and
runs true. If the armature core is unbalanced
or not true, the trouble should
be corrected before proceeding with
the remainder of the armature construction.
The armature winding is
not to be put on the core until the
commutator has been constructed and
mounted on the shaft.
</p>

<p>
The commutator consists of three
pieces of thin sheet brass similar to
that shown at B, Fig.&nbsp;1, mounted on
the surface of a cylinder of insulating
material, 3/8&nbsp;in. long and 7/8&nbsp;in. in
diameter. A 1/4-in. hole is drilled
lengthwise through the cylinder of insulating
material. Bend the pieces of
brass around the outside of the cylinder,
and turn all the lugs, except the
center one, marked C, over at right
angles and put a small nail or screw
through the holes in the ends of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_404' name='Page_404' href='#Page_404'>[404]</a></span>
lugs into the cylinder. These pieces
of brass are equally spaced around the
cylinder so that all the lugs, not
turned down, project in the same direction.
Now place a nut on the end of the
shaft that extends the greatest distance
through the armature, so that its outside
surface is 1/2&nbsp;in. from the surface
of the end of the armature core next
to it, and solder the nut to the shaft.
Place the commutator on the shaft so
that the projections on the pieces of
brass are toward the armature core
and the spaces between the ends of the
pieces occupy the position relative to
the cores, shown at A, Fig.&nbsp;2. Another
nut is then placed on the shaft and
drawn up tight against the cylinder.
The proper spacing of the various parts
on the shaft of the machine is shown
at D, Fig.&nbsp;1. Another small nut is
placed on the end of the shaft, away
from the commutator, so that its outside
surface is 1/2&nbsp;in. from the surface
of the end of the armature core.

  <p>Diagram of the Winding on the Armature and
Detail of the Field Laminations (Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
The threads on that part of the shaft
extending beyond the last nut on each
end are now filed off, which can be
easily done by placing the shaft between
the centers of a lathe and revolving
it quite rapidly, the file being
applied to the parts that are to be cut down.
</p>

<p>
Obtain a small quantity of No. 22
gauge single-cotton-covered copper
wire and wind four layers on each of
the three legs, or poles, of the armature
core, insulating the layers from
each other and the entire winding from
the core by means of paper and shellac.
The three coils are wound in the same
direction about their respective cores
and each winding is started at the
center of the armature with 2 or 3&nbsp;in.
of wire extending out toward the commutator.
The outside end of each
winding will terminate at the end of
the coil toward the center of the armature,
if an even number of layers is
wound on, and is securely fastened by
means of two or three turns of heavy
thread. The inside end of one coil is
then connected to the outside end of
the next one, and so on. These connections
can be easily made, and at
the same time the proper connections
made to the commutator, by cutting
the inside end of one coil and the outside
end of the next so that they will
reach the lug on the nearest segment
of the commutator, with about 1/4&nbsp;in.
to spare, then removing the insulation
from each for about 1/8&nbsp;in. and soldering
them both to the same lug. The
arrangement of the winding is shown
at A, Fig.&nbsp;2. Connect all of the coils
and segments in this manner, and the
armature of the motor is complete.
</p>

<p>
The field or frame of the machine is
made from a number of laminations
whose dimensions correspond to those
given in B, Fig.&nbsp;2. As many laminations
are used in the construction of
the frame as the number of pieces in
the armature, if iron of the same thickness
is used. Four of the laminations
have extensions at their lower corners
to correspond to the parts shown by
the dotted lines in B, Fig.&nbsp;2. Place
all of these laminations in a pile and
clamp them rigidly together, then drill
the four holes, indicated by the letters
C, D, E and F, with a 3/16-in. drill. Two
of the pieces with the extensions on
them are placed in the bottom of the
pile and the other two on top.
</p>

<p>
Place a 3/16-in. bolt through each of
the lower holes and draw up the nuts
on them tight. Procure two pieces of
3/16-in. rod, 1-1/2&nbsp;in. long, and thread each
end for a distance of 1/2&nbsp;in. Get 8 nuts
for these rods, about 1/8&nbsp;in. thick and
5/8&nbsp;in. across the face, if possible. Both
sides of these nuts are filed down flat.
Put the threaded rods through the two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_405' name='Page_405' href='#Page_405'>[405]</a></span>
upper holes in the field frame and
place a nut on each end and draw them
tight, leaving an equal length of rod
protruding from each side.
</p>

<p>
Obtain two pieces of 1/8-in. brass, 5/8&nbsp;in. wide, one 4-3/4&nbsp;in. long and the other
5-3/4&nbsp;in. long. Bend these pieces into
the forms shown at A, Fig.&nbsp;3. Drill a
3/16-in. hole in each end of both pieces
so that they may be mounted upon the
ends of the rods protruding from the
field frame. The exact center of the
space the armature is to occupy is then
marked on each of these pieces, and a
hole is drilled in each, having the same
diameter as the ends of the armature shaft.
</p>

  </a>
  <p>Detail of the Armature Supports and the Brushes,
and the Manner of Mounting the Brushes (Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
The extensions on the outside laminations
are bent over at right angles to
the main portion of the frame, thus
forming a base upon which the motor
may rest. Holes may be drilled in the
extensions after they are bent over to
be used in mounting the frame upon a
wooden base.
</p>

<p>
Procure about 1/2&nbsp;lb. of No. 18 gauge
single-cotton-covered copper wire and
wind it on the lower center portion of
the frame until the depth of the winding
is about 1/2&nbsp;in. Be careful to insulate
the winding well and, to insure
mechanical protection, place a layer of
adhesive tape outside. About 4 or 5&nbsp;in. of wire is allowed at each end for
making connections. It is best to have
these ends terminate on the commutator
side of the frame.
</p>

<p>
The brushes for the machine are
made from some thin sheet copper or
brass, and are shaped and dimensioned
approximately as shown at B, Fig.&nbsp;3.
Two pieces of hard rubber, or fiber, 1/2&nbsp;in. square and 7/8&nbsp;in. long, serve as
mountings for the brushes. These
pieces of insulation are mounted in the
corners of the armature support, at the
commutator end, by means of two
small screws in each. Mount the
brushes on these pieces so that their
free ends bear on the commutator exactly
opposite each other. One brush
is mounted on the upper end of its
support and the other brush on the
lower end of its support. This is shown
at C, Fig.&nbsp;3. Two small binding posts
are mounted at the same time as the
brushes, and are electrically connected
to the brushes, thus affording an easy
means of making a connection to the
armature. The brushes are so mounted
as to bear firmly upon the commutator.
</p>

<p>
To operate the motor, connect the
armature and field windings in series,
and the combination to a source of
electromotive force of several volts. If
it is desired to reverse the direction of
rotation, reverse the connections of
either the armature or field windings,
but not both. The motor may be
mounted on a neat wooden base and the
connections all brought down to a reversing
switch, which may also be
mounted on the same base as the
motor. The speed can be varied by
changing the impressed voltage, or by
connecting a variable resistance in the
armature circuit, such as a wire rheostat.
</p>

<p>
A small pulley may be made and attached
to the armature shaft so that
the motor may be used in driving various
kinds of toys.

<h2>
How to Make an Electric Heater
</h2>


<p>
The electric heater described in this
article is very simple to construct, its
operation exceedingly satisfactory, and
the necessary material easily procured
at a small cost at most electrical-supply
stores. The few tools needed are
usually found about every home, and
the heater may be constructed by any
ingenious person.
</p>

<p>
Procure 6 porcelain tubes, 20&nbsp;in. long
and approximately 13/16&nbsp;in. in diameter.
On each of these tubes wind 25&nbsp;ft. of
bare No. 26 gauge "Climax" resistance
wire. The various turns should be uniformly
distributed along the tubes and
not allowed to come into contact with
each other, which can be prevented by
placing a thin, narrow coat of plaster
of Paris along the side of each of the
tubes immediately after the winding
has been put on. Several inches of
free wire should be allowed at each
end, for making connections, and the
first and last turns on each tube should
be securely fastened to the tube by
several turns of binding wire. It would
be best not to extend the winding
nearer the ends of the tubes than 3/4&nbsp;in.
</p>

<p>
Cut from some heavy tin, or other
thin sheet metal, two disks, 6&nbsp;in. in
diameter, and punch six 5/16-in. holes
in each of the disks at equal distances
and within 3/4&nbsp;in. of the outer edge.
Punch two 1/8-in. holes in one of these
disks, to be used in mounting a porcelain
socket, and also one 1/2-in. hole
through which the wires may be led
to the socket, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. In
the other disk punch four 1/8-in. holes,
for mounting two porcelain single-pole
snap switches, and two 1/2-in. holes, for
leading the wires through to the
switches, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img407'>

  </a>
  <p>Detail of the Two Ends on the Heater Giving
Dimensions and the Location of Parts (Fig.&nbsp;1, Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
Cut off six lengths of 5/16-in. iron rod,
22&nbsp;in. long, and thread both ends of
each piece for a length of 1-1/4&nbsp;in.
Fasten the porcelain tubes between the
metal disks, by placing one of the rods
through each of the tubes and allowing
the ends to extend through the 5/16-in.
holes in the outer edge of the disks.
A nut should be placed on each end of
all the rods and drawn up so that the
length of rod protruding at each end
is the same. Obtain two single-pole
snap switches and a porcelain socket,
and mount them on the ends by means
of some small stove bolts.
</p>

<p>
The windings on the porcelain tubes
should be connected as follows: Let
the windings be designated by the letters
A, B, C, D, E, and F, and their
position be that indicated in Figs. 1 and
2. The primes indicate the ends of the
windings at the socket end, and the
letters without the primes indicate the
ends of the windings at the switch end
of the heater. The ends A and D
should be connected directly together.
The ends B and C to the clips of the
right-band snap switch, and E and F,
to the clips of the left-hand snap switch.
The ends F, A, and B should be connected
to one terminal of the socket,
and C, D, and E to the other terminal
of the socket. Electrical connection
is made to the winding by
means of a plug and piece of lamp cord.
It is obvious that the windings A and
D will be connected as soon as the
plug is screwed into the socket, if the
circuit is closed at all other points,
and the windings B and C, and E and
F are controlled by the right and left-hand
snap switches, respectively.
Make sure all the connections are properly
insulated, and that there is little
chance of a short circuit occurring.
</p>

<p>
After the socket and snap switches
have been connected to the windings,
two more thin disks, the same diameter
as the first, may be fitted over the ends
and held in place by two units on the
end of each rod, a nut being placed on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_408' name='Page_408' href='#Page_408'>[408]</a></span>
each side of the disks. A better way
of mounting these disks would be by
small machine screws that enter
threaded holes in the ends of the rods.
These last disks are not absolutely necessary,
but they will add some to the appearance
of the completed
heater. Four
small ears, about
5/8&nbsp;in. square,
should be cut on
the outer edge
of the outside or
inside disks and
bent over at right angles to the main
portion, to be used in mounting the
outside case of the heater.
</p>

<p>
Cut from a sheet of 1/8-in. asbestos
a piece just long enough to fit between
the inside disks and wide enough to
cover the three lower windings C, D,
and E. The object of this piece of
asbestos is to protect the surface upon
which the heater will stand from excessive
heat, since it is to rest in a
horizontal position.
</p>

<p>
Obtain a piece of perforated, thin
sheet metal, 19-1/2&nbsp;in. wide and long
enough to reach from one outside disk
to the other. Bend this into a cylinder
and fasten it to the lugs on the disks
by means of small screws or bolts.
</p>

  <img src='images/img408a.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p class='center'>(Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
The legs may be made of 1/8-in. strap
iron, 5/8&nbsp;in. wide, bent into the form
shown in Fig.&nbsp;3. These pieces may be
attached to the perforated cylinder,
before it is mounted on the heater
proper, by means of several small
bolts. The piece of asbestos should be
wired to the cylinder after the heater
is all assembled, so that it will always
remain in the lower part of the cylinder
and serve the purpose for which it is intended.
</p>

<p>
The heater, as described above, is
constructed for a 110-volt circuit,
which is the voltage commonly used
in electric lighting. The total consumption
of the heater will be approximately
600 watts, each part consuming
about 1/3 of the total, or 200 watts. If
it is desired to wind the heater for a
220-volt circuit, 25&nbsp;ft. of No. 29 gauge
"Climax" resistance wire should be
used on each tube.

<p>
Having occasion to saw some short

Pipe Caps Used as Castings for Engine Pistons
</h2>


<p>
Desiring to make a small piston for
a model engine and not caring to make
a pattern and send it away to have a
casting made, I thought of using ordinary
pipe caps, these being both inexpensive
and of a quality adapted to machining.
</p>

<p>
The cylinder bore was 1-1/2&nbsp;in. in
diameter, so I secured a standard pipe
cap for 1-1/4-in. pipe which gave an
outside diameter of about 1-5/8&nbsp;in. The
cap, not having sufficient depth for
holding in a chuck, was screwed on
a short piece of pipe and then trued in
the lathe chuck. The outside surface
was turned to a diameter of 1-1/2&nbsp;in.,
then removed from the pipe, reversed
and chucked again, and the threads
bored out to reduce the walls to 1/8&nbsp;in.
This made an excellent piston for a
single-acting engine.&mdash;Contributed by

<p>
A simple electric horn for use on a

can be constructed as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;1. The size will of course depend
somewhat on the use for which it is
intended, but one with the diaphragm
1-3/4&nbsp;in. in diameter and the horn 5&nbsp;in.
long and 4&nbsp;in. in diameter, at the large
end, will be sufficient for most purposes.
This will make the instrument
7-1/2 or 8&nbsp;in. in over-all length.

The horn proper, A, Fig.&nbsp;1, is constructed
first. This can be formed
from sheet brass. To lay out the metal
to the desired size draw a cross section,
as ABCD, Fig.&nbsp;2, then project the
lines AC and BD until they meet at
E. Strike two arcs of circles on the
brass sheet, using EC as radius for the
inner one and EA for the outer.
Measure off FG and HJ equal to 3-1/4
times DC and AB, respectively, and
cut out FGJH. Roll and lap 1/4&nbsp;in.
at the edges and solder the joint neatly.

<p>
After smoothing the edges on the
ends, solder a very thin disk of ferrotype
metal, B, Fig.&nbsp;1, to the small end
of the horn. This is used for the
diaphragm. Cut out a ring, C, from
1/4-in. hard fiber and bevel it on the
inside edge to fit the horn. Also make
a disk of fiber, D, having the same outside
diameter as the ring C. These
parts form the ends for a brass cylinder
E, which is made in two parts or
halves joined on the lines shown in
Fig.&nbsp;3. Fasten one of the halves, F,
Fig.&nbsp;3, to the fiber ring C and disk
D, Fig.&nbsp;1, with small screws, the other
half to be put in place after the instrument
is completed and adjusted.

consist of a soft-iron armature, H, Fig.
1, having a strap of spring brass, J,
attached by soldering and pivoted at
K, with an adjusting screw, L, to
set the tension. Another U-shaped
spring-brass strip, M, constitutes the
current breaker, which has an adjusting
screw, N. The points of contact
on the current breaker should be tipped
with platinum. A piece of brass wire,
O, is soldered to the diaphragm disk B
and the soft-iron armature H, to connect
them solidly. The tone of the
horn can be adjusted with the screws
L and N. The faster the armature
vibrates, the higher the tone, and vice
versa. The connections are the same

<h2>
Wire Expansion Meter
</h2>


<p>
When there is a current of electricity
in an electrical conductor a certain
amount of heat is generated due to the
opposition or resistance of the conductor
to the free passage of the
electricity through it. The heat thus
generated causes a change in the
temperature of the conductor and as a
result there will be a change in its
length, it contracting with a decrease
in temperature and expanding with an
increase in temperature. The temperature
of the conductor will change when
the current in it changes, and hence
its length will change, and it will reach
a constant temperature or a constant
length when the current in it is constant
in value and the rate at which it
is giving off heat is exactly equal to
the rate at which heat is being generated
in it.
</p>

<p>
The fact that there is an actual
change in the length of the conductor
due to a change in current in it constitutes
the fundamental principle of the
following simple instrument.

  <p>Meter for Measuring the Expansion of Metal Wires

</div>

<p>
The parts needed in its construction
are as follows: An old safety-razor
blade; one 8-in. hatpin; two medium-size
nails; a short piece of German-silver
wire; a small piece of sealing
wax; a 1/2-in. board for the base,
approximately 3-1/2&nbsp;in. by 10&nbsp;in., and a
small piece of thin sheet brass.
Remove the head from the hatpin and
fasten the blunt end in the center of
the safety-razor blade A with a piece of
sealing wax so that the pin B is perpendicular
to the blade as shown.
Now drive the two nails into the board
C, so that they are about 1/4&nbsp;in. from
the edges and 1-1/2&nbsp;in. from the end.
Fasten the piece of German-silver wire
D to these nails as shown. The size
of this wire will depend upon the value
of the current to be measured. Make a
small hook, E, from a short piece of
rather stiff wire and fasten it to the
hatpin about 1&nbsp;in. from the razor blade.
The length of this hook should be such
that the pointed end of the hatpin will
be at the top of the scale F when there
is no current in the wire, D. The
scale F is made by bending the piece
of sheet brass so as to form a right
angle and fastening it to the base. A
piece of thin cardboard can be mounted
upon the surface of the vertical portion
of the piece of brass and a suitable
scale inked upon it. The instrument
is now complete with the exception of
two binding posts, not shown in the
sketch, that may be mounted at convenient
points on the base and connected
to the ends of the German-silver
wire, thus serving as terminals for the instrument.
</p>

<p>
The completed instrument can be
calibrated by connecting it in series
with another instrument whose calibration
is known and marking the position
of the pointer on the scale for different
values of current.

<h2>
How to Make a Fire and Burglar Alarm
</h2>


<p>
A very serviceable fire and burglar
alarm may be installed by anyone who
can work with carpenters' tools and
who has an elementary knowledge of
electricity. Fire and burglar alarms
are divided into two general types,
called "open circuit" and "closed circuit," respectively.
</p>

<p>
In the open-circuit type of alarm all
the windows, doors, and places to be
protected are equipped with electrical
alarm springs which are in circuit
with an ordinary vibrating bell and
battery, and these alarm springs are
all normally open. When a window
or door is disturbed or moved
more than a predetermined amount,
the bell circuit is closed and the alarm
sounded. The arrangement of such an
alarm is shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. A switch,
A, is placed in circuit so that the alarm
may be disconnected during the day
and the opening and closing of doors
and windows will not operate the bell.
It is best not to place a switch in the
fire-alarm circuit as this circuit should
be in an operating condition at all
times.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img411'>
  <a href='images/hr_411.png'>
    <img src='images/img411.png'
    alt=''
    />
  </a>
  <p>Connections and Wiring Diagram Showing an Open-Circuit
Fire and Burglar Alarm (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
The alarm switch controlled by the
window consists of a narrow metal
plate, B, and a spring, C, mounted in
a recess cut in the side of the window
frame. The spring C is bent into
such a form that its upper end is forced
into contact with the plate B, when the
window is raised past the outwardly
projecting part of the spring C, and
the bell circuit is thus closed. The
position of the alarm switch can be
adjusted so that the window may be
opened a sufficient distance to permit
the necessary ventilation but not allow
a burglar to enter.
</p>

<p>
The alarm switch controlled by the
door is arranged in a different manner.
In this case the free end of the spring
D is held away from contact with the
spring E by the edge of the door,
which forces the spring D back into
the recess cut in the door jamb. When
the door is opened the spring E is
permitted to move out and come into
contact with the spring or plate E,
and the alarm circuit is thus closed.
The form of the spring D can be so
adjusted that the door may be opened
some distance, but not enough to allow
a person to enter, before the alarm
is sounded.
</p>

<p>
An alarm switch, identical with that
just described for the door, should be
mounted in the upper part of the window
frame to take care of the upper
sash. This alarm switch may be located
low enough to permit the window
to be lowered for the purpose of ventilation
without sounding the alarm.
</p>

<p>
The wires for these various alarm
switches should be run as near completely
concealed as possible to prevent
them being tampered with by curious
parties, who may unintentionally break
one of the conductors and thus make
some part of the system inoperative.
It might be best to test the system
occasionally, to make sure all switches
are in operating condition.
</p>

<p>
The fire-alarm switch consists of
two springs that are held from contact
with each other by means of a thin
cord. This switch is placed in the location
to be protected, or wherever a
fire is most likely to break out, such
as over the furnace, in the coal bin,
etc. When the cord is destroyed the
springs make contact and the alarm is
sounded. A metal having a very low
melting temperature may be used instead
of the cord, and the alarm will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_412' name='Page_412' href='#Page_412'>[412]</a></span>
be sounded when the temperature exceeds
a certain amount and the actual
occurrence of a fire thus prevented. In
some cases, the fire-alarm switch may
be completely destroyed and the alarm
circuit will then be opened and the bell
will cease ringing. To prevent this
trouble a small electric drop may be
placed in the circuit, the arrangement
being similar to that shown in Fig.&nbsp;2.
When the shutter of the drop falls, due
to the closing of the alarm circuit, there
is a second circuit closed, and this
second circuit remains closed until the
shutter is restored to its vertical or
normal position, or the switch, A, is
thrown to the open point. The addition
of the drop in the burglar-alarm
circuit may prove to be an advantage,
as a burglar cannot stop the alarm,
after he has once closed any of the
alarm switches and operated the drop,
by simply restoring the window or
door to its original position.
</p>

  </a>
  <p>Circuit Equipped with Drop to Ring the Bell
in Case the Switch is Destroyed (Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
In the closed-circuit type, the alarm
switches are all normally closed and
the alarm is sounded by opening the
circuit at some point. The arrangement
of such an alarm is shown in Fig.
3. The alarm switches are all connected
in series in this case and in circuit
with a closed-circuit battery and
relay or drop. The drop or relay controls
a local circuit composed of an
open-circuit battery and an ordinary
vibrating bell.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img412b'>

    />
  </a>
  <p>Wiring Diagram Showing Connections for a Closed-Circuit
Burglar and Fire Alarm (Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
The operation of a drop on a closed
circuit is a little different from its operation
on a normally open circuit.
The drop for the closed circuit must
be so constructed that its latch holds
the shutter in a vertical position when
there is a current in the drop winding,
but allows it to fall as soon as the drop
circuit is opened.
</p>

<p>
An ordinary telegraph relay may be
used in connection with the closed-circuit
alarm. The connections to the
relay are such that the bell circuit
is normally open and remains so until
the armature of the relay is released,
which does not occur until the
circuit of which its winding is a part
is opened at one of the alarm springs.
A special switch, A, and resistance,
B, are shown connected in circuit in
Fig.&nbsp;3, the object of which is as follows:
When it is desired to disconnect the
alarm springs or make them inoperative
they must be replaced by another
circuit which will permit a sufficient
current to pass through the relay
winding at all times, to prevent its
armature from being released and
sounding the alarm. The switch A
is so constructed that either the alarm
switches or the resistance B is in series
with the battery and relay winding at
all times, there being no open-circuit
position for the switch.
</p>

<p>
The fire-alarm switch for this type
of signal may be made from a narrow
piece of tin foil, or some metal having
a low melting temperature, mounted
between two insulated clips that are
connected in the alarm circuit.
</p>

<p>
Strips of gold or silver foil may be
placed on windows and connected in
the alarm circuit, which will give a
protection from theft by breaking the glass.
</p>

<p>
Two or three gravity cells will serve
very nicely for the closed-circuit battery,
while several dry cells will do for
the open-circuit or bell battery.
</p>

<p>
All types of alarm switches can be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_413' name='Page_413' href='#Page_413'>[413]</a></span>
purchased at any up-to-date electrical
supply house, but their construction
and operation is so simple that they
may be easily made by almost anyone.
A detailed description of the construction
of the various parts of the above
circuits will not be given here, but such
details can be safely left to the ingenuity
of the person installing the system.
</p>

<p>
It is easily seen from the above description
that a burglar who might discover
that a house was wired for alarm
would be greatly perplexed to know
what to do, for the very thing that
would prevent one kind of alarm from
ringing would cause the other to ring.

be quite vigorous and kept up until the
cloth is dry, then the spot should be
touched lightly with ammonia water,
which can be purchased at any drug
store. This will leave a slight blur,
which can be removed by rubbing with
French chalk on the wrong side. The
chalk is cheap and can be procured with

A D'Arsonval Galvanometer
</h2>


<p>
A galvanometer in which the moving
part of the instrument is a permanent
magnet controlled by the action
of the earth's magnetic field and the
magnetic effect of a current in a coil of
wire, that usually surrounds the magnet,
has the great disadvantage of having
its indications changed, although
the current itself may remain constant,
due to a change in the strength of
the magnetic field in which the instrument
operates. The operation of instruments
of the above type is satisfactory
only in localities where there
is a practically constant magnetic field
for them to operate in, which it is
almost impossible to have, due to the
presence of permanent and electric
magnets and magnetic materials such
as iron and steel.
</p>

<p>
An instrument constructed as follows
will not have the above disadvantage
and its operation will be a great
deal more satisfactory, as its indications
will be practically independent
of outside disturbances. In this instrument,
the moving part is the coil
carrying the current, and it moves in
a permanent magnetic field so strong
that other disturbing magnetic effects
can be neglected. The coil is hung by
means of a fine wire and the twist in
this wire is the only force acting to
bring the coil back to its zero position,
after it has been deflected, and maintain
it there.

  <p>The Permanent Magnet and Its Brass Support, and
Their Position on the Base (Fig.&nbsp;1, Fig.&nbsp;2, Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
The construction of the magnet and
containing case for the instrument will
be taken up first. Obtain a piece of
Norway iron, 1/2&nbsp;in. square and about
9&nbsp;in. long. Bend this piece into the
form shown in Fig.&nbsp;1, and file off the
inner edges until they are parallel and
about 7/8&nbsp;in. apart. Drill four 1/8-in.
holes in the ends of this piece, two in
each end, as indicated. This piece of
iron is first tempered and then magnetized
by placing it in contact with
a powerful electromagnet. Cut a second
piece from some soft iron with
dimensions corresponding to those
given in Fig.&nbsp;2. Drill two 1/8-in. holes,
A and B, in this piece as shown in the
sketch. This second piece is mounted
between the poles of the magnet, as
follows: Cut from some 1/32-in. sheet
brass a piece similar to the one shown
in Fig.&nbsp;3. Drill the holes indicated
and thread those designated by A, B,
C, D, E, and F to take a 1/8-in. machine
screw. Bend the upper end of
the piece over at the point indicated
by the dotted line until it is perpendicular
to the lower part. The center
of the hole in the projecting part K,
when it is bent over, should be about
1/4&nbsp;in. from the outer surface of the
main part of the piece. The small
piece of iron is then fastened to the
piece of brass with two round-headed
screws that pass through the two holes
in it and into the holes A and B in the
brass piece. The magnet is mounted,
also with small brass screws, so that
the main part of the magnet and the
piece of brass extend in opposite directions,
as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. The assembled
parts are then mounted on a
wooden board, whose dimensions are
given in Fig.&nbsp;1, with three brass screws
that pass through the holes G, H, and
J, as shown.

  <p>Upper and Lower Connections to the Coil and
Supports, and the Supports for Suspension (Fig.&nbsp;4, Fig.&nbsp;5, Fig.&nbsp;6, Fig.&nbsp;7)</p>
</div>

<p>
The moving coil of the galvanometer
is constructed as follows: Cut
from some 1/8-in. pine a piece 1-1/8&nbsp;in.
long and 5/8&nbsp;in. wide. Cut two other
pieces whose dimensions, except their
thickness, are 1/4&nbsp;in. larger than the
first piece. Then fasten these two
pieces to the sides of the first, with
three or four small screws through
each of them, thus forming a small
spool. Saw about 16 slots with a very
fine saw in the edges of the projecting
pieces and a short way into the edge of
the center piece. Wind on this spool
about 300 turns of No. 38 gauge silk-covered
copper wire. Start with the
terminal of the wire in the center of
one end of the spool, with a few inches
of free wire for making connections,
and end up with the terminal in the
center of the opposite end of the spool.
A small thread is then passed through
the slots under the coil and tied, thus
serving to hold the various turns of
wire together when the coil is removed
from the form. The coil should be
given a coat of shellac as soon as it is
removed from the form.
</p>

<p>
Two pieces must now be attached to
the top and bottom of the coil to be
used in making electrical connections
and suspending the coil. Cut from
some very thin sheet brass two pieces
whose dimensions correspond to those
given in Figs. 4 and 5. Drill a small
hole in the center of each of these
pieces. Bend the lower part of each
piece over at the dotted lines L until
it is perpendicular to the main portion
of the piece. The bent-over portions
of these two pieces are then fastened
to the ends of the coil with some
fine thread, making sure that they are
in the center of the ends before they
are fastened. The terminals of the
coil are now soldered to these pieces.
It would be best to place a sheet or
two of thin paper between the brass
pieces and the coil, to prevent any part
of the coil, except the ends, from coming
into contact with the brass pieces.
Obtain a small piece of thin mirror
and mount it with some glue, as shown
by the dotted lines in Fig.&nbsp;4.
</p>

<p>
The upper support for the suspension
is shown in Fig.&nbsp;6 and consists of
a 1/8-in. threaded screw, A, that passes
through the hole in the part K, Fig.&nbsp;3,
and is provided with two lock nuts,
B. The lower end of this screw
should be slotted a short distance, and
a small screw put through it, perpendicular
to the slot, so that a wire can
be easily clamped in the slot by turning
up the screw. Next, take a piece
of 1/32-in. brass, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;7, and
bend it at the dotted line A until it
forms a right angle. The hole B
should be threaded to take a 1/8-in.
screw. The holes C and D are for
mounting the piece on the back of the
instrument. Slot the end of a 1/8-in.
screw, about 1/2&nbsp;in. long, and put a
screw through the end as for the upper
support for the suspension. This
piece is mounted below the position
the coil is to occupy, as shown by
M, Fig.&nbsp;1.
</p>

</div>

<p>
A case should be made for the galvanometer
whose inside dimensions
correspond
to those
of the piece N,
Fig.&nbsp;1, and
whose depth is
about 3/4&nbsp;in.
more than the
thickness of that
piece. Four
pieces of wood
can be fastened
in the corners that will allow the case
to slip just far enough on the piece N
to make the edge of the case and the
back surface of the piece N flush. Cut
an opening in the front of this case,
about 2&nbsp;in. long and 1&nbsp;in. wide, in such
a place that the center of the opening
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_417' name='Page_417' href='#Page_417'>[417]</a></span>
is about level with the ends of the
magnet. Fasten, back of this opening,
a piece of thin glass with four
small screws whose heads rest upon
the edge of the glass. The interior
of this case and all the parts should
be given a coat of lampblack mixed
with a little vinegar. Two small binding
posts, O and P, are mounted on
the upper end of the piece N and connected
to the upper and lower supports
for the suspension of the coil.
</p>

<p>
This galvanometer will work best,
of course, when it is in an exactly vertical
position and the following simple
device, when attached to it, will allow
it to assume this position independent
of the level of the surface its base may
rest upon. Cut from some 1-1/8-in. brass
two pieces, 1/2&nbsp;in. wide and 2-1/2&nbsp;in.
long. Drill a 1/8-in. hole in the center
of each end of them, 1/4&nbsp;in. from the
end, and a 1/4-in. hole through the center
of each. Bend these pieces to a 3/4-in.
radius. Cut from some 1/2-in. hard
wood a block, 1-1/4&nbsp;in. square. Fasten
the two pieces of brass to the wooden
block with 1/8-in. screws, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;8. One of these pieces is fastened
to the upper end of the piece N, Fig.&nbsp;1,
so that the galvanometer will hang vertically.
The other piece is fastened to
a bracket from which the galvanometer
is suspended. A suitable bracket
for this purpose can be easily made.
When the galvanometer is hung in this
way, two binding posts are mounted on
the bracket, and connected to the two
on the galvanometer. In this way the
galvanometer will not be disturbed
when making connections.
</p>

<p>
The suspension is made as follows:
Take a piece of small copper wire and
roll it out flat. Solder one end of a
piece of this wire in the hole in the
piece of brass, with the mirror mounted
on it. Fasten a piece of the same
wire to the lower brass piece, attached
to the coil. The upper piece of wire is
then clamped in the end of the screw
A, Fig.&nbsp;6, so that the coil hangs perfectly
free about the iron core. The
lower piece of wire is bent around a
small rod several times and its end
fastened in the slot in the lower screw.
</p>

<p>
The deflection of the instrument is
read by causing a beam of light from a
lamp or candle to be reflected from the
mirror to a scale located in front of the
instrument. If the light from the lamp
is allowed to shine through a small slit
in a piece of dark paper, there will be
a streak of light reflected upon the
scale, instead of a spot.
</p>

<p>
To use this instrument in measuring
larger currents than it will safely
carry, connect it in parallel with another
resistance which will carry the
larger part of the total current. The
galvanometer can be calibrated with
this resistance, which is known as a shunt.

Preserving Paints and Pastes
</h2>


<p>
White lead, thick shellac, and pastes
that are used occasionally may be preserved
by laying a piece of leather over
the exposed surface. When these materials
are kept in cans, cut a piece of
leather from the upper of a heavy boot
of such a size that it will drop freely
into the container. Form a handle on
the leather disk by driving a nail
through its center from the under side.
Press the disk down smoothly over the
surface of the contents and a thin film
of oil will soon form over the disk,
effectually excluding the air. A loose
cover is placed over the container, to
keep out dust.&mdash;Contributed by Luther

<p>
As it was necessary for me to solder
the joints of fine wires on electrical
instruments, and other small work, I
found myself in
need of a blowpipe
that gave a
small but very
hot and easily directed
flame, was
automatic in its
operation and required
no blast.
I tried an ordinary acetylene burner on
coal or city gas, and found it gave an
intensely hot, nonluminous flame, due
to the forced draft of air through the
small holes. This flame will melt silver,
copper and, also, silver solder. Its
great advantage lies in the fact that it
may be used for sweating together
small articles rapidly and with great
neatness. I always keep this blowpipe
burning, as the gas it consumes is very
small, and the burner is kept within
easy reach by using a hanger, as shown
in the illustration.
</p>

<p>
A single jet of flame is obtained by
stopping up one of the tips, which is
very useful in many ways. This flame

When the leaves of a book are accidentally

parts in a solution of oxalate of potash,
or better still, oxalic acid. This
will remove all the ink. Treat again

How to Make an Electrotype Stamp
</h2>


<p>
The method described in the following
produces a very good metal stamp
for any name, initial, drawing, etc.
</p>

<p>
Procure a smooth and perfectly level
sheet of brass about 1/16&nbsp;in. thick and
about 3 by 4&nbsp;in. in size. Nickelplate
the brass so that the copper deposit
will not stick to it. If a small plating
outfit is not at hand the piece may be
plated at a local plating works for a
nominal price. Dip the plate in melted
paraffin until the coating is about 1/16&nbsp;in. thick and see that no metal is exposed.
Drill a hole in one corner and
attach a wire.
</p>

<p>
Draw the letters or sketch desired,
using a metal stylus having a sharp
point, taking care to make the lines
scratched in the wax clean and open
to the surface of the metal (Fig.&nbsp;1).
</p>

  <img src='images/img419bf1.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Making the Copper Shell (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
A large open-mouthed bottle or glass
tank will be required for the plating
solution, which is made by dissolving
copper sulphate in water until the solution
is saturated with the sulphate
and then adding a few drops of sulphuric
acid. Immerse the plate in the
solution as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2 and connect
with the zinc pole of the battery.
Put a piece of pure copper in on the
opposite side of the jar and connect
with the carbon pole of the battery,
using care in each case to keep the
connection of the wire and the upper
part of the plate above the surface.
One or two dry cells will be sufficient.
If the current is right, the deposit on
the waxed plate will be a flesh pink;
if too strong, it will be a dirty brick
color and the plate will have to be
washed and the current reduced.
When the desired thickness of metal
is deposited, remove the plate and pour
boiling water on the back. This will
remove the thin copper shell and the
nickeled plate may be laid away for
future use.

little resin or soldering flux on the
back. Lay three or four sheets of the
lead from tea packages on the back of
the shell and heat it over a spirit
lamp or on the stove until the lead
melts and runs into the crevices on the
back of the copper, thus making it
solid and suitable for mounting.

of sal ammoniac to every 2&nbsp;qt. of
liquid. Fill the dry-cell vessel with
this solution and allow it to remain until
the blotting paper is completely saturated.
</p>

<p>
Obtain a good size electric-light carbon,
about 5/8&nbsp;in. in diameter, and file
one end down as shown. Drill a hole
through the carbon and mount a terminal.
</p>

<p>
Make a mixture of equal parts of
finely powdered carbon and manganese
dioxide of sufficient amount to almost
fill the vessel. Add to this mixture
some of the solution and thoroughly
mix them. Continue adding solution
until a thick paste is formed.
</p>

<p>
Pour the solution out of the vessel
and allow the latter to drain for a few
minutes in an inverted position. Place
the carbon rod in the center of the vessel
and pack the paste down around
it, being careful not to move the carbon
rod from its central position. The
vessel should be filled with the paste
to within about 5/8&nbsp;in. of the top. The
lower end of the carbon rod should not
be nearer the bottom of the vessel than
1/2&nbsp;in. Over the top of the paste place
a mixture of equal parts sand and fine
sawdust and then, over this, a layer
of pitch, which acts as a seal for the
cell. A layer of blotting paper should
be placed between the sand-sawdust
mixture and the carbon-manganese
mixture. The side lining of the vessel
should be turned in before the sand-sawdust
mixture is placed in the top of
the cell. The outside of the cell
should be covered with some heavy
pasteboard, which will serve to insulate
the negative terminal from the
surface upon which the cell rests.

After spending considerable time in

the settee described
in a recent
issue of
Popular Mechanics
Magazine, I
devised the plan
shown in the

one in the ordinary
manner.
Two metal
plates, one of
which is shown
in the sketch, having a perfectly

with the straight edge on the line of the
mortise. A hacksaw is applied through
holes bored at the ends and a cut sawed

<p>
To protect the poultry from mites
and other insects while roosting, I constructed
a roost hanger, as shown, with
oil cups made of
empty shoe-polish
cans. The
cover of the box
was nailed to the
roost and the
bottom, for holding
the oil, on
top of the roost
support. A large
nail was driven through the support
from the under side and through the
center of the can bottom, so that about
1-1/4&nbsp;in. projected above the latter.
</p>

<p>
The can cover was perforated in the
center and a hole, about 1/2&nbsp;in. deep,
was drilled in the roost so that the end
of the nail would easily slip into it.
The bottom of the can was filled with
a mixture of kerosene, vaseline and carbolic
acid and the roost set in place.
Both ends of each roost are fixed in the
same way. This makes it impossible
for any insects to get on the roost.&mdash;Contributed

The ordinary method of using sticky

this trouble is to make a holder for the
paper, and one can be constructed of a
piece of wire and a metal cover taken
from a jelly glass. The wire is threaded
at one end on which the cover is
clamped between two nuts. The upper
end of the wire is shaped into a hook
for hanging it wherever desired. The
paper is rolled with the sticky side
out and tied with strings, then slipped
over the wire and set into the inverted
cover. The cover prevents any of the
sticky substance from dripping onto
the floor and the wire holds it from being
blown about the room.&mdash;Contributed

Small blocks of wood can be hardened

them in olive oil for about 10 minutes.
The olive oil can be kept for
future use. If it is desired to waterproof
the blocks after hardening them,
they should be placed in melted paraffin
and allowed to cool in the solution.
This gives the block of wood a good

<h2>
Gear-Cutting Machine
</h2>


<p>
Perhaps the last thing that would be
thought within range of the amateur
who lacks a full equipment of machinery
is the cutting of gear wheels. The
device shown in the sketch is very
practical, and, with the most ordinary
assortment of iron-working tools, will
serve to turn out an accurate gear.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img424f1'>
  <img src='images/img424f1.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Details of Gear-Cutting Machine (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
No system of supports is shown, as
they are easily supplied. A flat, square
board, B, as large as can be obtained&mdash;2&nbsp;ft. on a side being the safest minimum&mdash;is
used for a dial. A sheet of
paper is pasted over the entire board
and a large circle drawn on it. This
circle is divided into as many parts as
there are to be teeth in the gear. A
depression is made with a prick punch
at each division. A shaft, C, is run
through the center, to which an arm,
A, is firmly attached. A nail, N, is
placed at the end of the arm so that
the point can enter each of the punch
marks on the periphery or circumference
of the circle. A blank wheel, W,
is attached to the shaft C, in the position
shown, and resting on the iron
plate or strap F. A cutting tool, D,
works up and down in a slot in F.
This cutter is held away from the
blank wheel by the spring S, and moved
up to it by the screw G, acting
through the sliding member H. A
stove bolt may be used for G, with the
nut firmly fastened to the strap F.
The cutter is actuated with a handle
E, whose motion is limited by the pegs
as shown. In Fig.&nbsp;2 is shown a top
view of the strap E, with a cross section
of the cutter and the slot in which
it works.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img424f2'>
  <a href='images/hr_424f2.png'>
    <img src='images/img424f2.png'
    alt=''
    />
  </a>
  <p>(Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
The operation of the mechanism is as
follows: With the blank wheel in
place set the nail N in one of the punch
marks and move the handle E downward.
This will make a slight cut on
the wheel. Then give the screw G a
turn or two, which will make the cutter
take a deeper bite, and push the
handle down again. This operation is
repeated, screwing G constantly
deeper, until it is stopped by the locknut
J, which regulates the depth of the
cut. Move the nail N to the next punch
mark and repeat. The operations are
very quickly performed and the circle
will be closed almost before you
know it.
</p>

<p>
There are several points to be observed.
The accuracy depends upon
three things. First, the slot through
which the cutter passes must be tight-fitting,
even at the expense of working
hard. Second, the shaft C must fit
tightly in the holes made for it through
B and F, also the arm A must be firmly
attached, the shaft being filed flat at
the point of attachment. The blank
wheel should be keyed on the shaft or
securely fastened with a setscrew.
Third, the nail N must enter the punch
marks accurately. As the grinding
circle is so much larger than the blank,
any error here is greatly reduced in
the finished wheel. Once in a punch
mark the nail must not be allowed to
slip until the tooth has been cut.
</p>

<p>
In practice, it will be found better,
after each stroke of the handle, to give
a quarter turn outward to the screw G,
thus avoiding the scraping of the tool
on the up stroke. The cutter can be
made of any suitable steel with the cutting
point ground to give whatever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_425' name='Page_425' href='#Page_425'>[425]</a></span>
shape is desired for the tooth. The
best shape for any particular purpose
can be found by reference to a book
on gears.
</p>

<p>
This cutter is adapted, of course,
only to the softer metals. For experimental
purposes a blank cast in type
metal is excellent and will last as long
probably as required. The mechanism
here described will cut brass perfectly
well and a gear made of this more durable
metal will answer for a finished
construction. Type-metal blanks commend
themselves because they are so
easily cast, any flame which will melt
solder being sufficient, and the molds,
of wood, plaster of Paris or any easily
worked material, being quickly constructed.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
An Easy Way to Develop Roll Film
</h2>


<p>
This is simply a different motion to
the tiresome seesaw one usually employs
when films are being developed.
In wetting them down previous to immersion
in the developer, do not keep
them in the water long enough to become
limp, but remove them after a few
quick dips, says Camera Craft, They
will then retain some of their curling
tendency, so that by taking one end in
one hand and gradually lowering the
film into the dish of developer and then
raising it out of the dish, it will be
found that the film will roll and unroll
quite readily, much as one would let
out or wind in a reel. This method
will result in quicker development, because
the roll is nearly always immersed
in developer. The method
necessitates using only one hand, making
it possible to develop a second
strip at the same time with the other.
The illustration shows quite clearly
just how the film will behave.

How to Make a Small Vertical Drill

</div>

<p>
A small hand drill with a three-jaw
chuck that will take the smallest drill
can be purchased
very reasonably.
For ordinary
work these drills
do very well, but
for comparatively
deep holes, or
when using long,
slender drills,
some sort of a
stand should be
made, if for no
other reason, to
avoid breaking
the drills, which
is almost invariably
due to the
side motion of
the hand. There
are other reasons, however,
for making such
a stand, and
these lie in the fact that it is impossible
to drill by hand at right angles
with the surface of the metal, or to
hold such a drill sufficiently steady to
avoid widening the hole around the top.
</p>

<p>
As each make of hand drill will require
a somewhat different form of
stand, no detailed description need be
given of the one illustrated. The principal
point is to have the base and
standard securely set at right angles
to each other, and then provide a
smoothly sliding piece to which the
hand drill may be clamped. The edges
on this slide and the corresponding
guides should be planed off to an
angle of 45&nbsp;deg. One of the guides
should be adjustable, which may be
arranged by elongating the screw
holes and placing small washers under
the heads of the screws that hold this
guide to the main standard.
</p>

<p>
A neat little hand drill, arranged in
this manner and firmly secured to the
bench, may also be used for finishing
the ends of small shafts, either flat
or pointed, for polishing screw heads,
etc., to all of which it gives that workmanlike
appearance that can only be
had when things are polished with a
true rotary motion.&mdash;Contributed by

<h2>
Drill Press on an Ordinary Brace
</h2>


<p>
As the greater part of the energy required
for drilling metal by hand is
used for feeding the drill, I made what
I term a drill box in which the brace
is held perfectly true and pressure is
applied by a weight. The feed can
be changed for the different metals
and sizes of drills, also for drilling the
hard outside of castings and relieving
the drill for the softer body. The constant
feed will cause the drill to turn
out a long chip, and a number of holes
may be drilled to a uniform depth by
using the same feed and counting the
turns of the brace handle.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img427bf1'>
  <img src='images/img427bf1.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Weights Apply a Constant Pressure to the
Drill, Which can be Easily Turned (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
To build the box, first find the dimensions
of the brace, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;1: the diameter of the head A, the
clearance B from the top of the head
to 1/4&nbsp;in. above the top of the handle
C, and the over-all length D when the
longest drill is in the brace. Make a
box having an inside length equal to
the dimension D, plus whatever additional
height may be necessary for
the work. Make the inside width twice
the distance C, plus 6&nbsp;in. for clearance;
and the inside depth the length C, plus
one-half of the dimension A, plus 3&nbsp;in.
Use material 7/8&nbsp;in. thick and nail the
parts together to form a rectangular
frame. Cut a piece of broomstick as
long as the dimension B, and two
pieces of wood as long as the inside
width of the box and as wide as the
dimension B. Cut two pieces 1/16&nbsp;in.
longer than the dimension A and as
wide as the length B. Nail these latter
pieces together as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2,
leaving a square space in the center.
This frame is to be nailed inside of the
top of the box flush with the front,
but before doing so lay it on top of
the box to determine where the center
of the square space will come, and
bore a hole, large enough for the round
stick cut from the broom handle to slip
through easily, then nail the frame
on the under side of the top piece.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img427b'>

  <p>(Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
Procure a tough piece of wood, 1-1/2&nbsp;in. square and long enough to project
2&nbsp;in. over the right and 10&nbsp;in. over
the left side of the box top, and when
in this position, locate the hole bored
for the round stick and bore a hole in
the square stick, 1/8&nbsp;in. deep, to coincide
with it. Place the head of the
brace in the guide and push it up until
it touches the top of the box and block
it up in this position, then drop the
round stick through the hole and rest
it on the head of the brace. Place the
socket in the lever over the top of the
round stick. Make a loop, 8&nbsp;in. long,
of heavy wire and hang it over the
right end of the lever and mark the
box at the lower end of the loop. Turn
in a large screw 1/2&nbsp;in. below this mark
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_428' name='Page_428' href='#Page_428'>[428]</a></span>
allowing it to project enough to hook
the loop under it. Remove the round
stick and put a screw at the point the
bottom of the loop reaches when the
lever is flat on the top of the box.
Another screw turned in between these
two will be sufficient to hold the lever

of from 5 to 10&nbsp;lb., are used on the

Homemade Picture-Frame Miter Box
</h2>


<p>
Any person wishing to make a picture
frame, or to cut down an old one,
requires a miter box for that purpose,
so that the molding may be properly
held while sawing it, and also for nailing
the corners together. I made a
miter box, as shown, and found it to
be just the thing for this purpose. It
is built on a base similar to an overturned
box, the saw guides being held
on the ends of a piece, constructed as
shown at A. Holes are cut in the top,
as shown at B, for one of the guides
and for the two wedges. Two pieces,
C, are fastened with their outer edges
at perfectly right angles on the top.

Tank-Development Methods Used in Tray Development
</h2>


<p>
If there are a number of plates to
be developed, place a rubber band,
about 1/8&nbsp;in. wide, around the ends of
each plate and put them together in a
tray. The bands keep the plates apart.
The developer is made up as for a
tank and poured over the plates, then
another tray, or dark covering, is
placed over the top. Allow this to
stand, rocking the tray from time to
time, the same length of time as is
required for tank development.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Homemade Ellipsograph<br />
By Chelsea Curtis Fraser
</h2>


<p>
An efficient ellipsograph is the only
device that will make true ellipses of
various sizes quickly, and such a machine
is in demand on some classes of
work in a drafting room. Its cost,
however, is prohibitive where only few
ellipses are to be drawn, but a person
handy with tools can make an apparatus
that will do the work as well as
the most expensive instrument.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img429f1'>
  <img src='images/img429f1.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Practically Any Size or Proportion of
Ellipse, from 1-1/2 to 16&nbsp;In. Maximum
Diameter, can be Drawn with an
Instrument of This Size, and Larger
Instruments will Work Equally Well (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
The completed ellipsograph, herein
described, will appear as shown in Fig.
1. It consists of two main parts, the
base and the arm. The former is a
hardwood piece, A, Fig.&nbsp;2, to the side
center of which is attached another
hardwood piece, B. This latter piece
may be dovetailed into A, but an ordinary
butt joint will suffice, as a one-piece
base, C, also of hard wood, is
glued to the bottom surfaces of the
pieces A and B, thus securely holding
them together. Before gluing, however,
care must be taken to see that the
piece B is exactly at right angles with
the piece A. This can be done with
a try-square. Dimensions are given
in Fig.&nbsp;2. The same letters are used
throughout for the same parts.
</p>

  alt=''

  <p>(Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
A 1/16-in. groove, H, is cut out at the
juncture of A and B, to admit the
flange of the minor-axis swivel head.
Another groove, J, is made along the
longitudinal center of the piece B, to
receive the spine of the major-axis
swivel head. Sheet brass plates, D and
E, are cut from 1/16-in. stock and attached
to the top of the piece A with
screws. The plates F and G are of the
same material and fastened in a like
manner to the upper surface of the
piece B. All plates project slightly
where they touch the groove borders,
as shown. This is to provide a bearing
for the projections on the sliding parts
against metal instead of wood. A piece
of thin celluloid or brass plate, K, is
inserted in the bottom side of the base
C so that the point will be exactly in
line with the center groove J, and extend
outward 1/8&nbsp;in. This point indicates
the center of all ellipses to be
drawn. In the bottom of the base C,
at each end, drive an ordinary pin and
cut it off so that a part of it will project
beyond the surface of the wood.
These extending ends are pointed with
a file, and serve to keep the instrument
from slipping when in use.

<p>
The arm L is shown in Fig.&nbsp;3. It is
made of either maple or birch. Follow
the dimensions given, cutting a slot
through it longitudinally, as shown at
M, narrower on the upper side than on
the lower, the upper being 1/4&nbsp;in. wide.
An octagon-shaped piece of wood, N,
1/2&nbsp;in. thick, is glued to the end, to give
a good seating for the sleeve O, which
is a piece of 1/2-in. solid-brass rod, 2&nbsp;in. long, drilled to receive closely the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_430' name='Page_430' href='#Page_430'>[430]</a></span>
pencil sheath. The latter, P, can be
made from a section of brass tubing
such as is used in a bicycle-pump valve.
The upper end is notched to receive
a rubber band, and an ordinary pencil
can be cut down to fit closely into the
other end. The piece O fits tightly in
a hole bored through N and L.

</div>

<p>
The detail of the minor-axis swivel
head is shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. This swivel
head consists of two pieces of brass,
one, marked Q, being 3/8&nbsp;in. square by
3/4&nbsp;in. long and the other, R, 7/8&nbsp;in.
square by 1/2&nbsp;in. long, with a notch
cut out as shown. These parts, as well
as the somewhat similar ones for the
major-axis swivel head, can be cast
cheaply, or block brass may be cut
with a hacksaw and filed to the right
shape. A shortened dry-cell screw, S,
with washer, to fit a tapped hole drilled
in the piece Q, serves to bind the head
where desired on the arm. The flange
T is a piece of 1/16-in. brass driven into
a slot cut in the piece R. The piece
R is pivoted to the piece Q, as shown,
by means of a piece of wire nail which
engages Q, by friction, the lower end
being fitted with a washer and riveted
loosely so that the parts will turn freely.

  <p>Fig.&nbsp;5</p>
</div>

<p>
The major-axis swivel-head detail is
shown in Fig.&nbsp;5. The piece U is the
same size as Q, Fig.&nbsp;4, with its screw
set a little farther forward to make
room for the pivot V, which loosely
joins U and W together. The pivot
is made of a wire nail, riveted on both
ends. The piece W is of brass, 1/2&nbsp;in.
thick, 3/4&nbsp;in. wide and 7/8&nbsp;in. long. The
spine X is made just thick enough to
pass freely in the groove J, Fig.&nbsp;2. A
screw taken from a discarded dry-battery
cell is used to bind the head
to the arm.
</p>

<p>
To operate the ellipsograph, draw
a line, Y, Fig.&nbsp;1, on the paper, which
is to mark the major axis of the ellipse.
About midway of its length make a
point to represent the center. On the
latter set the point K, Fig.&nbsp;2, and adjust
the bottom forward edge of the base C
parallel with the line Y. Set the minor-axis
swivel head at such a point on
the arm L that, when the latter is
directly on top of the piece B, the pencil
will touch the paper at a distance
from the center, marked by K, equal
to half the minor axis of the proposed
ellipse. To secure the major axis swing
the arm until it is parallel with the
piece A, leaving the major-axis swivel
head unset, and set it when the pencil
point has been adjusted to the proper
major radius.
</p>

<p>
Grasp the arm with the right hand
between the swivel heads and bearing
down, swing the pencil end from right
to left. The rubber band will keep it
constantly on the paper with even
pressure. When half of the ellipse is
completed detach the rubber band and
reverse the instrument to the opposite
side of the longitudinal line Y and
draw the other half in the same manner.

<h2>
Arts-Crafts Leather Work<br />
By Mary C. Scovel
</h2>


<h3>
Part I
</h3>

<p>
Leather work
is one of the
most interesting
of the crafts,
first, because the
material is so
pliable that anyone
can work it,
and secondly, because any ordinary
article can be made by simply following
the directions carefully, although each
of the various kinds of leather demands
a different process.
</p>

<p>
The equipment necessary is simple,
consisting of two special tools costing
50 cents each, one with a narrow edge
for lining patterns, and one with broad
ends for tooling; and a piece of tin,
plate glass, or very
smooth hard wood,
which should not be
smaller than 9 by 12&nbsp;in. A soft sponge, a
triangle, a rule, tracing
paper and a hard
pencil are also needed.
</p>

<p>
The first attempt
should be made on a
piece of Russian calfskin.
This may be
purchased at any
leather store or craft
shop and costs about
50 cents a square
foot, if cut to measure.
Whole skins contain from 8 to 12
sq. ft. and cost about 35 cents a square
foot. Calfskin may be had in almost
any color.

<div class='img' id='img432b'>
  <img src='images/img432b.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Coin Purse&mdash;Front</p>
</div>

<p>
The coin purse will be the first article
described. The size, pattern and design
must first be determined. It consists
of three parts, the front, back and
flap, as shown in the sketch. This
purse will require a piece of leather 4
by 8&nbsp;in., in order to allow an extra
1/4&nbsp;in. outside of
the pattern to
pin the leather
on the board
while transferring
the design.
The upper flap C
folds  over  the
front of the purse D. The design must
be divided, the part belonging to C
placed on the flap, and the part belonging
to the front D, on the lower part
of the front.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img433a'>
  <a href='images/hr_433a.png'>
    <img src='images/img433a.png'
    alt=''
    />
  </a>
  <p>Pattern for Purse</p>
</div>

<p>
Take a piece of paper and fold it in
accordance with the desired proportions
of the purse, taking care that the
design for the front D is on the same
side of the paper as that of the flap C.
The space F under the
flap is without any design.
The design for
the front D is on the
lower part of the upper
division of the pattern.
Fold the part
F behind H, and then
the part C behind H
and F. Turn the pattern
over for the
proper position of
the purse. Draw the
entire design on
tracing or tough tissue
paper. Wet the
leather on the wrong
or unfinished side with a soft sponge.
Pat the leather and endeavor to moisten,
but not soak it, with water. On
some leather the water, if it comes
through, leaves a stain. When the
leather is too wet it is very hard to
tool, as the tool sticks and makes an
uneven background.
</p>

<p>
Pin the design firmly down against
the leather and fasten the leather with
thumb tacks on the outer margin.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_433' name='Page_433' href='#Page_433'>[433]</a></span>
With a hard pencil go over every line
of the design with a firm, even pressure.
If the leather is properly moistened,
this will leave a clear outline of
the design when
the tracing paper
is removed. Then
with a lining
tool&mdash;the tool
with the narrow
edge&mdash;go over
the lines on
the leather with
a strong, firm
stroke. Should a
line design only
be desired, this
operation finishes
the decoration.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img433b'>
  <img src='images/img433b.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Stamp-Case Pattern</p>
</div>

<p>
Two other
methods may be
used: tooling or
stamping. The
design shown
does not go to the
edge of the pattern. A margin of at
least 1/8&nbsp;in. between the edge of the
pattern and design must be left for
tooling and stamping. For tooling,
after lining the pattern, use the broad
end of the tool and make
even, long strokes to
press down the background.
If the background
is not easily
pressed down, the leather
is too dry. Take it off the
board and moisten the
back again, move the tool
back and forth and around
until the background is
comparatively smooth.
Keep the edges very sharp
between parts pressed
down and those that remain
raised. The depth
of pressing down the
background is a matter of
taste, but it should be
tooled down enough to
make the design stand out
plainly. Fold the parts together and
line with silk to match the leather and
then stitch up the front and back parts
of the purse close to the edge. This
can be done on any sewing machine,
or by a shoemaker. The circle M in
the pattern is the catch or button
which can be furnished and put on by
a shoemaker, or
at a trunk store.
</p>

<p>
Any ordinary
article of leather
can be stitched on
a sewing machine
in the home. To
do this successfully
the stitch
must be long and
the needle of a
large rather than
a small size. Try
the stitch on a
scrap of leather
before sewing the
article. If the foot
or feed of the machine
mars the
leather, place tissue
paper or a
plain piece of paper over the leather
and stitch through both. After making
the stitch the paper can be pulled
away. Use as heavy a silk as the
needle will take. The card case, coin
purse, stamp case and
bags can all be stitched
on an ordinary machine,
if the above directions are
followed. In stitching
any soft leather, such as
ooze cow or ooze calf, if
paper is not put between
the leather and the machine,
the stitching will
stretch the leather. In
making bags, instead of
stitching on a machine
one can punch holes close
together with a small
punch, and then with
strips of leather sew the
sides together over and
over, or in any manner
desired. If no machine is
at hand, nor a shoemaker's
shop nearby, a large pin or
awl may be used to prick holes in the
leather, and then the parts sewed together
with needle and silk. Use a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_434' name='Page_434' href='#Page_434'>[434]</a></span>
running or over-and-over stitch. An
over-and-over stitch from one end of
the seam to the other and back to the
beginning of the seam, makes an X-shaped
stitch which gives a very good finish.
</p>

<p>
The second method after tooling is
stamping. Line the pattern as described.
Purchase a common carpenter's
nail set, with the head not too
large. The smaller sets fit the patterns
better and make smaller circles.
Moisten the leather as described. Use
a wooden mallet to strike the tool in
stamping the background. This may
be done either along circular lines or
in a more irregular manner, but avoid
striking the tool too hard, as too much
pressure cuts through the leather.
Other stamping tools of good patterns
may be purchased at hardware stores
or crafts shops.
</p>

<p>
A needle book or stamp case is
another handy article to make in
leather. The sketch shows the design.
A piece of Russian calf, 6-1/4 by 3-3/4&nbsp;in.,
is necessary. This allows 1/4&nbsp;in. on
each side and end for pinning down the
pattern. Fold a piece of paper into
three parts as A, B and C, the front
being A; the back, B, which is folded
underneath the part A. The flap C
folds up with B and then over A
toward the front. When the pattern
is open, the design for all parts must
be on the same side of the paper. The
design for the back B is put on the
leather upside down. When the pattern
is folded this makes the design
upright. The parts A, B and C are
equal in length and width. The part
C may be cut in any shape desired,
but keep the tongue D long and narrow.
Make two horizontal cuts in the
front A about 3/16&nbsp;in. apart.
</p>

<p>
These cuts must be at the same distance
from the bottom of the front as
the narrowest part of the tongue is
from the end. The tongue will then fit
the cuts. Make the horizontal cuts a
little wider than the tongue. The design
is put on the leather in the same
manner. It can be worked out in line,
tooling or stamping. The parts A and
B are sewed together.

How to Make a Wood Lathe
</h2>


<p>
A strong, substantial lathe in which
wood and light metal articles may be
turned can be made by carefully following
the description below and the
detailed drawings of the parts.
</p>

  <p>Detail of Wood Lathe (Fig.&nbsp;1)</p>
</div>

<p>
The bed is made of two pieces of
straight-grained, smooth, 2 by 4-in.
hard wood, 5&nbsp;ft. long. They are held
apart at each end by blocks of wood
2&nbsp;in. wide. The bed can, of course, be
made longer or shorter if desired, but
the above dimensions are very satisfactory.
The frame of the headstock,
Figs. 1 and 2, is made of hard wood.
The two end pieces have the dimensions
and shape shown. These are
fastened with screws to the base.
</p>

  <p>(Fig.&nbsp;2)</p>
</div>

<p>
The base has a slider, a strip of
wood 1&nbsp;in. thick and 10&nbsp;in. long, wide
enough to slide smoothly between the
bed pieces, nailed to its bottom, 2&nbsp;in.
from the rear end. Two 1/2-in. holes
are bored through the baseboard and
slide. Two 1/2-in. bolts are run through
these holes and through another slide
and board which runs on the under
side of the bed.
</p>

<p>
When the nuts on these bolts are
tightened, the headstock is firmly
clamped to the bed. A half-round,
wedge-shaped piece is fastened with
screws in the frame against the front
end, to serve as a brace against any
strain, and will also add to its appearance.
The spindle is of tool steel or
steel tubing, 3/4&nbsp;in. in diameter and 14&nbsp;in. long. Threads are cut on one end.
</p>

<p>
A hardened steel collar, 1/4 by 1-1/2&nbsp;in.,
is riveted on the spindle so it may turn
against another collar of the same size
on the headstock. Another collar is
fastened with screws to the rear end
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_436' name='Page_436' href='#Page_436'>[436]</a></span>
piece, and a collar with a removable
pin is fixed on the spindle. These
should be fitted so as to revolve easily
against each other and yet have no
end play. The bearings are of brass
tubing drilled for a spindle. These
are inserted and wedged in the headstock,
6&nbsp;in. from the bed.
</p>

<p>
Care should be taken to see that
they are in line. Small holes are
drilled from the top for oil. The pulleys
are 2&nbsp;in. wide with the diameters
given in the drawing. They are
fastened to the spindle with a removable pin.

A good chuck for this lathe is made,
as shown in Fig.&nbsp;3, of a piece of shafting

long. A 1/2-in. hole is drilled through
its center and one end reamed out
and threaded to fit the threads on the
end of the spindle. A setscrew is
fitted over the 1/2-in. hole. A center
for turning wood is also shown.
Many centers, drills, etc., can be made
of 1/2-in. tool steel.

<p>
The tailstock, Figs. 4 and 5, is built
up of three pieces of hard wood, 2&nbsp;in.
thick, and one piece, 1&nbsp;in. thick,
shaped as shown. These are held together
with four bolts, 7-1/2&nbsp;in. long.
It has sliders and is clamped to the
bed in the same manner as the headstock,
but only one bolt is used. A
handle is welded to the nut. This
will make the clamping easy.

  <p>SECTION THROUGH Fig.&nbsp;4 (Fig.&nbsp;6)</p>
</div>

<p>
A piece of tubing, 2&nbsp;in. long, is drilled
for a 1/2-in. dead center and inserted
for 1-1/2&nbsp;in. between the two upper
pieces, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;6. A hole for
a 1/2-in. bolt is bored through the sections
so as to allow the bolt to slide
freely in the tubing. The top section
is taken off and a place chiseled out
just back of the tube for a 1/2-in. nut.
A bolt, 7&nbsp;in. long and threaded for 2&nbsp;in. of its length, is turned into the
nut and tubing. A handle or wheel is
riveted on the end of the bolt. The
center is made of tool steel, 1/2&nbsp;in. in
diameter, with a tapering point. Other
centers can be made of 1/2-in, tool steel.

<p>
The tool rest, Figs. 7, 8 and 9, has
a slide, 3/4 by 3 by 13&nbsp;in., with a slot
1/2 by 6&nbsp;in. The base of the rest is
bolted on this slide so it can be
adjusted. The rest is fastened on this
base with screws. The height of the
rest can be varied. It can be raised
or lowered by inserting wedges between
the slide and the rest base. The
tool rest is clamped to the base the
same as the tailstock.

<h2>
To Reduce the Gasoline Consumption of an Automobile
</h2>


<p>
Quite recently I tried out a method
of reducing the consumption of gasoline
in my automobile, and, as a result,
have higher efficiency without resorting
to any of the numerous and exceedingly
costly devices on the market.
</p>

<p>
I procured a piece of wire screen, cut
it in the shape of the gasket between
the carburetor and the intake manifold,
but leaving it blind, that is, with the
screen across the inlet. I put this between
two gaskets and fastened the
whole back in place. The result was
an increase of 3 miles per gallon of fuel.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Cutting a Tin Ball from a Child's Finger
</h2>


<p>
A three-year-old child found a globe
of tin with a hole cut through the center,
and&mdash;it is hardly necessary to state&mdash;immediately
thrust his finger into
the hole. But he could not get it out
again, and the mother, accompanied
by several other small children,
brought the screaming child to my
office. I found the hole had been
punched, which caused three harpoon-like
fragments to be carried into the
center of the globe.
</p>

<p>
The mother in her attempt to remove
it had caused the sharp points
to enter the flesh of the finger in two
or three places. Any attempt to pull
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_437' name='Page_437' href='#Page_437'>[437]</a></span>
the ball off, drove the points of the
harpoons deeper into the finger, and
it was therefore a question of cutting
the tin or the finger. But what kind
of an instrument could I use on this
tin globe?
</p>

<p>
I had nothing in my case that would
cut it. My 35 years of medical experience
gave me no help. The tin was as
hard and smooth as a glass marble.
Yet, it would have been ridiculous to
be thus conquered by a tin whistle, so
after some meditation I called to mind
that I had a pair of heavy tinner's snips
in the basement. By using the utmost
care I succeeded in cutting a small incision
in the round ball, and then with
the points of the shears I cut the metal
away from the finger.
</p>

<p>
Such an accident may come under
the observation of any parent, and if
so, he can use the same method to
relieve the child where medical assistance
is not near at hand.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Child's Seat for Theaters
</h2>


<p>
As children must hold tickets for
theaters the same as adults, but the
ordinary chair is too low to permit a
child to see the performance, an auxiliary
seat such as shown in the sketch
would sometimes be desirable as it
elevates the child so its head will be on
a level with those of other spectators.
The seat is made of a strip of canvas
with eyelets for wire hooks that fit
over the arms of the ordinary theater
chair. It is necessary to have extra
eyelets at one end of the canvas to
adjust it to varying widths of seats.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Locating Gas and Electric Fixtures in the Dark
</h2>


<p>
A gas or electric fixture in the center
of a room is quite hard to locate in the
dark; more so if it is a single-light
pendant. The location may be easily
found if the fixture is marked as follows:
Coat small pieces of cardboard
on both sides with phosphorus and
suspend them from the fixtures with
small wires. No matter how dark the
room may be, the phosphorus on the
cardboard can be readily seen. The
phosphorus is the same as used on
matches and can be obtained from any
druggist. The phosphorus, being
poisonous, should be handled as little
as possible, and, after using, should be
returned to the water-filled jar in
which it was received when bought.
If left in the open, it may cause fire.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
A Pea-Shooting Gun
</h2>


<p>
The gun consists of only two parts.
The barrel may be either a piece of
bamboo fishing pole or a section of
sweet alder. The spring is a piece
of corset steel, such as can be usually
found about the home.
</p>

  <p>A Pea-Shooting Gun Made of a Piece of Alder
and a Corset String</p>
</div>

<p>
Sweet alder can be found in the summer
growing along the fences in the
country almost anywhere. Find a stalk,
about 1&nbsp;in. in diameter, which is good
and straight, and cut it off to a length
of 6 or 7&nbsp;in. Make a ram rod of wood
and use it to punch out the pith of the
alder, rendering the bore as smooth as
possible. An old bamboo pole of like
dimensions may be used instead.
</p>

<p>
Cut out a section of the wood, 2-1/2&nbsp;in. long, beginning 1-1/2&nbsp;in. from one
end of the tube. The depth of this cut
should be almost halfway through
the piece. The corset steel is then inserted
into the short end of the tube
and bent over so that its other end will
touch the bottom of the open part of
the bore. A nick is made with a knife
across the bottom of the bore at this
point, to let the spring catch a little.
The ammunition is placed before the
caught end of the spring, as shown,
and discharged by hooking the forefinger
over the spring at the point A
and pulling backward as when pulling
the trigger of a gun.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to keep the muzzle
elevated a little after the ammunition
is placed in position, otherwise the pea
will roll out before the spring has a
chance to strike it.

<h2>
Coloring Electric-Light Globes
</h2>


<p>
Often it is desired to produce certain
effects in lighting which demand a
different-colored light than that given
by the modern tungsten lamp. As an
example, a soft, mellow light is sometimes
desired similar to that given by
the old carbon-filament lamp. In such
cases it is a great mistake to install the
carbon lamps on account of their exceedingly
poor efficiency.
</p>

<p>
The ordinary tungsten lamp has an
average efficiency of about 1.2 watts
per candlepower, while the carbon-filament
lamp requires about 3 watts
per candlepower. Therefore, it is much
more economical to color the globe of
the tungsten lamp so as to produce the
required color than to use the carbon
lamp. Of course, both lamps must be
colored when any color other than a
soft, yellow light is desired.
</p>

<p>
A cheap coloring solution may be
made as follows: Soak a small amount
of gelatin in cold water for several
hours, then boil it and strain it through
a piece of fine cloth. While the solution
is still hot, add a small quantity of
aniline dye of the desired color that has
been previously mixed in a small
quantity of cold water. The lamps are
dipped in the solution and then allowed
to cool in a vertical position so that the
coating will be more uniform.
</p>

<p>
A more satisfactory coloring solution
may be made from celluloid. Obtain
quite a number of old photographic
films and remove all the gelatin
by washing them in hot water.
Then dissolve them in a solution of
equal parts of ether and alcohol. Add
the coloring solution and dip the lamps.
The coating produced by this method
is impervious to water.

<h2>
Arts-Crafts Leather Work<br />
By Mary C. Scovel
</h2>


<h3>
Part II
</h3>

<p>
When laying out designs for leather
work, avoid making them too small
and intricate. Bold, simple designs are
the best. The relation between the
shapes of the background and of the
design should be well balanced. The
design should not be so small that the
large background shapes overbalance
it. One good way is to let the design
partly follow or repeat the contour of
the object. If the article be rectangular
in shape, let some of the lines of
the design follow rectangular lines;
and if circular, follow the curves of the circle.
</p>

<div class='imghr' id='img441a'>

  <p>Pattern for a Cardcase</p>
</div>

<p>
The first piece of leather work considered,
will be an artistic
cardcase. The
foundation of a cardcase
is a rectangle.
Take a piece of paper
10 by 4-3/4&nbsp;in. and fold
it in the middle, making
each side 5&nbsp;in.,
then fold in 2&nbsp;in. on
each outside edge toward
the center. This
last fold makes the
pocket of the case. If
a deeper pocket is desired,
a longer piece
of paper must be used,
and the fold more
than 2&nbsp;in. Cut out
the leather according
to the paper pattern
and allow at least 1/4&nbsp;in. for the margin.
This gives enough extra
material for fastening the leather
on a board outside of the pattern.
Moisten the leather on the rough or
unfinished side. Remember that, as
previously stated, Russian calfskin is
the best for tooling. Place the folded
paper on the right side of the leather,
then with a ruler, triangle and lining
tool draw the vertical lines where the
paper is folded. If the leather is moistened
enough, the tool will make a deep
line.  Make these lines where the
leather is to be folded in the center,
and for each pocket. Line all around
the pattern on four sides to indicate
the outside border of the pattern.
Note that there are
four vertical panels or
rectangles, two wide
ones and two narrow
ones, as the leather
lies flat on the board.
Select either of the
wider rectangles for
the front of the cardcase.
Transfer the
design onto this side.
Place the paper on
the moistened leather
and go over all the
lines of the design
with a hard pencil.
When this is done,
take the paper away
and deepen the lines
of the design with the
lining tool. If tooling
is desired, use the
broad-end tool and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_440' name='Page_440' href='#Page_440'>[440]</a></span>
press down the background with firm
even strokes. Keep the background
and edges of the design sharp. If
stamping is desired, make rows of
small circles, regular or irregular, by
using the nail set and a wood mallet.
The inside or lining is made of skiver
leather or silk. The two center rectangles
are the only parts lined. Cut
out the piece of silk or leather about
1/16&nbsp;in. less at the top and bottom of
the rectangles and 1/4&nbsp;in. wider on each
side. If leather is used, apply library
paste on its back, then place carefully
on the inside, smooth it down firmly
and put it under a heavy weight to
dry. If silk is used, apply the paste
around the edges for a width of about
1/4&nbsp;in., and put it under the weight.
The case is then folded and sewed at
top and bottom. Cut off the surplus
leather about
1/8&nbsp;in. from the stitches.

  <p>Silk Lining of Magazine Cover</p>
</div>

<p>
The next
article is the
useful magazine
cover,
which anyone
should delight
in making. It
requires
a piece of
leather 11 by
15&nbsp;in. Allow
enough margin
to fasten
it to the
board. Fold
the narrow
edges together. The design can be
placed on either side. A border design
bounded by rectangular lines is
very suitable. The margin allowed
around the design shown in the illustration
is 1&nbsp;in. from the front edge,
1-1/2&nbsp;in. from the top edge, and 2-1/4&nbsp;in.
from the bottom edge. The design
is 5-1/4&nbsp;in. wide. It is placed on the
moistened leather and lined, tooled or
stamped as described for the cardcase.
The inside of this cover is lined
with heavy silk. Allow a 1/4-in. margin
to turn in on all four sides. Two strips
made of the lining material, 2-1/2&nbsp;in.
wide and 11&nbsp;in. long, are placed 1-1/2&nbsp;in.
from each side, over the lining on the
inside. The lining, strips and the
leather are stitched together about 1/8&nbsp;in. from the edge on all four sides.
The strips are to hold the magazine
in place as
the cover of
the book is
slipped between the
cover and the strip.

<p>
Other kinds
of leather,
such as ooze
cow and ooze
calf, may be
used, but
these only allow
the method
of cutting
out the design, as
shown in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_441' name='Page_441' href='#Page_441'>[441]</a></span>
bag and stampcase. The design is
traced on the wrong or smooth side
of the leather. Do not moisten the
ooze leather. Fasten
the leather
firmly on the
board and cut out
the design with a
sharp knife.  A
soft silk is best
for the lining. Apply
the paste on
the leather near
the edge of the
design and after
laying the silk in
place, put it under a weight to dry.

  <p>Handbags</p>
</div>

<p>
The stampcase and handbags are
laid out, and the designs made in the
same manner as for the cardcase and
magazine cover, but instead of stitching
the edges
on the handbags,
they are joined
with thongs run
through holes cut
in the edges of
the leather. The
stampcase edges
are sewed together.
Bear in mind
that Russian calf
is used for tooling
and stamping,
and ooze cow or calf for perforated designs.

<h2>
Furnace Electrodes of Lead Pencils
</h2>


<p>
Furnace electrodes frequently consist
of carbon rods, and if there is a
short gap between them, forming a
break in the circuit, the current jumps
across that gap, forming an "arc." The
intense heat of the arc is used in fusing
and melting metals. As large
electrodes are necessary for use in furnaces
where great masses of metal are
melted, so small electrodes are adapted
to finer or more delicate work, says
Popular Electricity.

  <p>Pencil Electrodes Which Furnish Intense Heat</p>
</div>

<p>
As the lead or graphite in a lead
pencil is a form of carbon, it will make
an excellent electrode for small work.
Two ordinary lead pencils, costing only
one cent each, may be used. They are
first sharpened as if they were to be
used for the usual purpose of writing.
Then a small notch is cut in one
side of each pencil, laying the lead
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_442' name='Page_442' href='#Page_442'>[442]</a></span>
bare at a point about 2&nbsp;in. from the
sharpened end.
</p>

<p>
A small copper wire is wound around
the pencil and into this notch, thereby
making contact with the exposed lead
or graphite. By means of these small
wires the pencils are connected to
larger wires, which in turn are connected
to a switchboard or source of
electric-current supply.
</p>

<p>
At some place in the circuit there
should be a resistance to prevent short-circuiting
and also to control the
strength of the current. As the wood
sheath on the pencils offers sufficient
insulation, they may be picked up, one
in either hand, and no electrical effect
will be felt by the person so doing. If
the pointed tips are touched together, a
fine little arc, not much larger than the
tips of the pencils, will be formed. The
temperature of this arc, however, is
such that fine wires or small quantities
of metal may be melted readily.
</p>

<p>
These little lead-pencil arcs may be
used to fuse very small gold or silver
wires, or platinum thermometers, or
wires for tungsten or tantalum lamps.
The bead or globule of molten metal
formed on the end of a fine wire need
be no longer than a small-sized grain
of sand.

  <p>Details of Hangers</p>
</div>

<p>
The back is first marked off on a
soft-pine board and cut out. The
curved edge should be rounded off so
as to prevent injury to the coat. The
two end pieces are then made, and
fastened to the back with screws as
shown. The wedge is ripped diagonally
from stock and the smaller edge
made slightly round. The wedge
slides in between the two end pieces,
and after the trousers have been put
in place, is pushed down until it holds
them securely. The hanger is a screw
hook turned into the wood, or it may
be made of a piece of heavy wire run
through a hole in the back and bent
over on the bottom edge. The wood
may be stained any desired color and
then given two coats of shellac.&mdash;Contributed

Mending Broken Fountain-Pen Barrels
</h2>


<p>
Broken fountain-pen barrels may be
mended by the use of melted shellac.
This can be done by heating some dry
shellac and applying it to the fracture.
Do not scrape off the surplus shellac,
but shape it with a heated iron. A pen
with such a repair has been in use for
two years.&mdash;Contributed by G. D.

Jig-Saw Blades
</h2>


<p>
The ordinary form of jig-saw blade
has a tendency to pull the fiber of the
wood in one direction, thereby producing
a jagged cut. To overcome this I
made several blades with teeth as
shown in the sketch. After the downstroke
is completed, the teeth A will
cut on the upstroke, the teeth B cutting
on the downstroke, etc. The upstroke
teeth should be a trifle longer
than the others and from 4 to 6&nbsp;in
number.&mdash;Contributed by Phillip Caflish,

<h2>
Leaded-Glass Panels for Furniture
</h2>


<p>
Certain kinds of furniture may be
greatly improved in appearance by the
use of simple glazed panels in the door
frames. It would be inappropriate to
have anything elaborate in a small
cabinet for the reception of china as it
distracts the attention from the contents,
but a simple leaded diapering or
pattern of small design, such as shown
in Figs. 1 and 2, would be quite in
place and have a good effect. For
other purposes more elaborate effects
can be worked out in deep shades, says
Work, London.

can be used either for furniture or for
small windows. The process of making
these panels is not difficult and the
ordinary workman can form them, the
only difficult part being the soldering
of the joints.

  <p>A Small Hanging Cabinet with Doors Having the
Leaded-Glass Design Shown in Fig.&nbsp;2 (Fig.&nbsp;3)</p>
</div>

<p>
The beginner should confine himself
to plain glazing, the design being
formed by piecing together glass of
different shades. The method of procedure
is to first make a small sketch
in color to a scale of about 1&nbsp;in. to the
foot, carefully arranging the parts and
colors. A full-sized panel can be
drawn from this sketch. The effect of
plain glazing depends entirely on the
arrangement of the lead lines and the
art glass. In the full-sized drawing
the shapes are arranged so that they
may be easily cut, all long forms being
either avoided in the design, or divided
by a cross-lead to guard against breakage
in the cutting.

is considerably elaborated in Figs.
5, 6 and 7. It is desirable to decorate
only a part of a window so that the
maximum of light may gain access.

  <p>Example of Plain Glazing with Cross Section of Glass

</div>

<p>
For this lead glazing a quantity of
strip lead, the section of which is
shown in Fig.&nbsp;11, will be required.
This can be purchased from dealers in
art-glass supplies. The lead is sold
on spools and it must be straightened
before it can be worked. This is most
easily done by fastening one end and
pulling on the other. The glass for
this work must be reasonably thin as
no advantage is gained by the use of
thick material, and it is difficult to cut.
A piece of art glass has a right and a
wrong side, the side on which the spots
and streaks appear is the right side,
and it is cut on this side. The tools
required are a glass cutter, a heavy
knife and soldering appliances.

</div>

<p>
Sketch out the lines of the design
full size on paper, drawing in only one
side of a symmetrical pattern and tracing
the other. After the design has
been prepared, the next
step is to make a cutting
pattern. To do
this, take a piece of
tracing cloth and lay it
on the drawing. Trace
the lines and go over
them with a brush
dipped in black, making
the lines exactly
the same thickness as
the core of the lead, or
the thickness of the
distance the glasses are
separated from one another,
as shown in Fig.
11. Each division is
marked for the color it
is to be and the paper is then cut into
sections on each side of the broad line.
These pieces form the patterns for cutting
similar shapes from heavy cardboard
which serve as templates for
cutting the glass.
</p>

<p>
Proceed to cut the glass by laying
a pattern on the right side and scoring
around with the cutter guided by the
pattern. Little difficulty will be experienced
in this work if the general
design does not have very irregular shapes.

have been successfully cut and are
ready for leading up, arrange them in
position on the preliminary sketch,
and then measure the outside leads and
cut one piece for each side, the lead
being cut to fit against the core of the
other at the joint, as shown in Figs. 12
and 13. Proceed to cut the lead for
the long curves obtaining the length
by bending the strips along the lines
of the design. As each is cut it will
be found convenient to tack it in position
on the working table by means
of small brads, so as to simplify the
measuring and cutting of the other
parts. Continue until the panel is
complete, when, after truing up, it is
ready for soldering. This is done in
the usual way but requires extraordinary
care to avoid the possibility of
melting the lead. The overlapping
parts of the leads are pressed well
against the glass in each division to
keep it from rattling.

  <p>The Main Ambition of a Boy Mechanic is to Own a Lathe</p>
</div>




<h2>
Amateur Mechanic's Combination Lathe<br />
By Joe V. Romig
</h2>


<p>
The thing most desired by a young
mechanic is a lathe, but the cost of
these machines is usually too high to
be considered by the average boy, and
consequently he is hampered in executing
more difficult work. The combination
lathe shown in the illustration
comes as near filling the wants
of most boy mechanics as could be
wished, the attachments making it
more than a lathe so that various kinds
of work other than turning may be
accomplished. The materials necessary
are few, and,
outside of a few
parts, it can be
constructed by the
average boy at
home with ordinary tools.
</p>

<p>
The material
used for the construction
of the
frame consists of
either well seasoned
oak or maple,
2-3/4&nbsp;in. wide
and 1-1/2&nbsp;in. thick.
These timbers can
be purchased
surfaced on
all sides, and
they must be
straight and
true to size.
The lengths to
cut the pieces
are given on
the general drawing. The end standard
at the headstock is cut to the full
length so that the upper end is used
as a bearing for the headstock spindle.
A vise jaw, about 2-1/2&nbsp;ft. long and of
the same kind and dimension material
as the frame, is attached with screws
made of bolts on the standard, at the
tailstock end of the lathe. The feet
are made of two boards for each standard,
and are of the same material as
the frame and 7/8&nbsp;in. thick. After cutting
the pieces to the right length,
making sure that the ends are square,
and boring the holes to receive the
bolts snugly, they are put together,
the horizontal pieces for the ways and
feet at perfect right angles to the uprights.
This will insure the parts running
freely in the finished machine. All
bolts should be supplied with a washer
under both head and
nut, and the nuts
drawn up tightly.
</p>

<p>
The headstock extends
7&nbsp;in. above the
upper surface of the
ways, thus making a
swing of 12&nbsp;in. One
of the standards of the
headstock is the extension
of the lathe standard,
as previously mentioned;
the other standard
being cut 9-3/4&nbsp;in.
long and attached with
bolts between the ways
in the same manner as
the lathe standards are
fastened. A block, 3&nbsp;in. long, is fastened between
these standards
to aid in holding them
rigid. The
bearings for
the spindle,
which is a
piece of steel,
3/4&nbsp;in. in diameter
and about
9&nbsp;in. long, are made in the upper ends
of the standards in the following
manner:
</p>

<p>
A 1-1/4&nbsp;in. square is laid out on the
upper end of each standard, with its
center exactly over the center for the
shaft, and the wood is cut out to make
a square hole, which should be slightly
tapering one way or the other toward
the center of the standard, to hold the
babbitt metal used for the bearing. A
3/8-in. hole is bored, vertically down
from the upper end of each standard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_448' name='Page_448' href='#Page_448'>[448]</a></span>
and in the center, to meet the square
hole. This is used as a gate for pouring
the melted metal in and later to
make an oil hole. Prepare 8 pieces of
cardboard to hold the melted metal
in the square holes while it cools, by
cutting them about 2&nbsp;in. square and
making a hole in the center of each, 3/4&nbsp;in. in diameter. Two of these pieces
are held between the two standards
while the shaft is run through them
and the square holes. Paint the parts
of the shaft used in the bearing with
thick white lead, or wrap it with one
thickness of writing paper, then line
it up perfectly parallel with the ways
in both directions and tack the cardboard
pieces to the standards.  Place
the remaining two cardboard disks on
the ends of the shaft and tack them to
the standards also. Place putty over
all the edges and pour melted babbitt
metal into the hole at the top. When
the metal is cool, remove the cardboard
disks and turn the shaft, first in one
direction and then in the other, until
it can be taken from the bearings. A
1/8-in. hole is then drilled through the
metal in the top for an oil hole. The
ends of the shaft should be threaded
by a machinist, and nuts fitted to it and
faced up true. The threads should be
cut just long enough to allow the back
of each nut to turn freely against a
washer placed on the shaft against the
standard. A split or solid pulley may
be used, as desired, on the shaft between
the standards. If a solid pulley
is used, it must be slipped on the shaft
as the latter is run into the bearings.

</div>

<p>
The pulley is fastened to the shaft with
a pin run through a hole drilled in
them. If a small flywheel is attached
to the outer end of the spindle it will
aid in keeping a steady motion.
</p>

<p>
The same procedure is carried out in
the construction of the tailstock bearings.
The standards for this part are
about 8&nbsp;in. long and are bolted at right
angles to and between two pieces that
rest on top of the ways. The shaft is
threaded full length, which should be
done in a lathe by a machinist to get a
true thread, and the melted metal run
on it to make an internal thread in the
bearing. A nut is run on the threads
of the shaft between the standards, and
provided with a small handle for use
in locking the shaft when it is set on
work between centers. A small handwheel
is attached to the back end of
the shaft, into the rim of which a handle
is set to make the turning easy.
</p>

<p>
The faceplate consists of a disk of
metal, 6&nbsp;in. in diameter and 1/4&nbsp;in. thick,
attached with 3/16-in. machine screws
to a 3/4-in. nut. The disk is drilled in
various places to receive ordinary
wood screws. The faceplate should be

Shape of the Tools Used in Turning, Together with the Faceplate and Spur
Construction</p>
</div>

<p>
The drive wheel for this lathe was
taken from an old discarded washing
machine. Such a wheel is a very common
part of various kinds of machinery
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_450' name='Page_450' href='#Page_450'>[450]</a></span>
and usually one that will answer the
purpose can be found in a junk pile.
One from 20 to 24&nbsp;in. in diameter will
be about right. A 1/2-in. bolt is used
for the shaft, which is run through the
standard at the headstock end of the
lathe from the outside, the threads being
previously cut long enough to introduce
a nut between the wheel and
the standard for clamping the bolt in
place. The extending threaded end of
the bolt is then supplied with two nuts,
one on each side of the wheel hub,
and a short piece of pipe is slipped on,
to make a bearing over the threads.
One of the spokes is drilled and a pin
inserted and fastened to receive the
upper end of the pitman from the
treadle. The wheel is adjusted on
the shaft with the nuts on each side of
the hub so that its face runs true
with the pulley on the headstock. The
wheels are connected with a 1-in.
leather belt.
</p>

<p>
The treadle consists of a frame built
up of boards and swung in the centers
at both ends on 3/8-in. steel rods, for
bearing pins, the bearings being made
of wood standards with 3/8-in. holes
bored in them to receive the pins. The
pitman is made of wood, its length
being determined by measurement of
the distance between the crank pin
and the treadle-arm end when both
are at their lowest point.
</p>

<p>
The slide for the rest consists of a
1-in. square steel bar, about 10&nbsp;in. long,
having a hole drilled in one end and
threads cut with a 1/2-in. tap. The
rest used in this hole is made of a 1/2-in.
rod, threaded on one end and bent at
right angles on the other. The clamping
device for the slide is made of two
bars, 1&nbsp;in. by 3/16&nbsp;in., fastened to the
square bar and extending down between
the ways with sufficient ends
beneath to attach a wooden clamp
block and cam with a handle. This
construction is clearly shown in the
drawing. If only a lathe is required,
the machine would be complete as now
described, but the other attachments
illustrated will greatly add to its usefulness
and the owner will be well repaid
by making them.
</p>


<h3>
Attachments
</h3>

<p>
One table is used for the circular
saw, planer head, sander, and jig saw,
and it is attached on top of the headstock
and tailstock standards with
bolts, run through the back edge of
the board and the ends of two brackets
which are screwed to the back edge
of the inner standards. Thumb nuts
are used on the bolts to aid in making
the change quickly. More than one
hole is provided in the back edge of
the board, so that the tailstock bracket
can occupy the right position for the
sander or planer head, as the case may
be. The holes in the bracket ends
should be somewhat larger than the
bolt, to allow tilting of the table. An
adjusting screw is substituted for the
rest, so that the table can be raised or
lowered to suit the work in hand.
</p>

<p>
The circular saw is 5&nbsp;in. in diameter
and should have fine teeth. It is placed
on the spindle threads against the nut,
and held there with another nut and
washer on the end of the spindle. The
table is attached over the saw, and the
spindle is driven at a high speed.
</p>

<p>
The planer head is made of a wood
block, 9&nbsp;in. long and 2-3/4&nbsp;in. square. A
3/8-in. hole is bored through one way
near each end, as shown in the drawing,
and two steel knives, with 1/2-in.
holes coinciding with the 3/8-in. holes
in the wood, are made and attached
with their edges opposite or projecting
diagonally from the corners. The holes
in the knives being larger than the
bolts, makes the knives adjustable for
setting the cutting edges. These knives
may be made from an old saw blade,
ground to size and one edge beveled
and sharpened. A brass plate, with
holes to fit the spur center, is fastened
in the center of the block, on one end,
and the other is centered for the cup
of the tailstock screw. The adjusting
screw for the table is used to regulate
the cut.
</p>

<p>
The sander is constructed of a wood
piece, 9&nbsp;in. long and 3-3/8&nbsp;in. in diameter.
A groove is cut in one side of the
rounding surface to admit the ends of
the abrasive which may be fastened
there with tacks.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_451' name='Page_451' href='#Page_451'>[451]</a></span>
An emery wheel can be used on the
spindle in the same manner as the circular
saw. Procure a wheel, 5&nbsp;in. in
diameter with a 1/2-in. face and having
a lead center. The hole should be
bored out and tapped to fit the threads
on the lathe spindle, and to have the
grinding surface run true, this work
should be done in a lathe by a
machinist.
</p>

<p>
The drawings show the construction
of the jig-saw attachment. The standard
on which the arms are pivoted is
made of a 1/2-in. bolt, threaded for its
entire length and with a groove cut in
the head and nut to receive the arm
pivots. A locknut is used beneath the
notched nut to hold the adjustment.
Two nuts and washers are used near
the center of the bolt for clamping the
attachment to the table. The pivots
are made of sheet metal, bent and
drilled as shown. The small projection
at each end of the edge is raised
slightly by hammering the corner of
the metal. These projections prevent
the arms from sliding sideways. The
clamps for holding the ends of the saw
blades are easily made of thin sheet
steel, or brass, with a 3/16-in. bolt and
washer at the end for the clamp. The
tension of the blade is secured by a
piece of wire, an eyebolt and a thumb
nut, connecting the rear ends of the
arms as shown. The frame is driven
by the spur center. The pins are removed
from the center and a 1/4-in. pin
is inserted in one of the holes so that
it will project 5/8&nbsp;in. The pin runs in
a slot cut in a brass plate that is attached
to the lower arm.
</p>

<p>
Very serviceable tools can be made
of discarded files by grinding them to
shape on the emery wheel. Always
use a fine whetstone to finish the edge
on a woodworking tool.

<h2>
Hanging a Clothesline Taut
</h2>


<p>
The line is equipped with rings, one
at each end, used for convenience in
quickly hanging the line, which is then
drawn taut with a lever. A screwhook
is fastened in one end post and at the
other end a screwhook is attached to a
lever which is pivoted to the post.
The lever should be about 3&nbsp;ft. long,
1&nbsp;in. thick, 3&nbsp;in. wide at one end, and
1-1/2&nbsp;in. wide at the other, or handle,
end. A large wood screw is used to
attach it to the post. A pin is placed
in the post to hold the lever when the
line is drawn taut.&mdash;Contributed by

<p>
This latch is suitable for outbuildings,
small shops and sheds, as it can
be opened from
both sides of the
door and is easily
applied. It
consists of a rod
of suitable size
which is bent in
the shape shown
in the sketch after
the rod is inserted
through a
hole bored near the edge of the door.
The spring of the metal will hold the

Maulstick Used as a Ruler
</h2>


<p>
Procure a cork having the same
diameter as the knob on the maulstick
and make a hole in the center so that
it will slide on the stick. This is very
handy for using the stick as a ruler, as
it forms a sliding rest.

<h2>
Hinge with a Wide Swing
</h2>


<p>
In constructing a box I needed a
hinge that would carry the cover
farther away from the top than the ordinary
double-leaf hinge. I found that
two pieces of 1/4 by 5/8-in. wrought iron,
attached in the manner shown, answered
the purpose. By using round-head
screws it was unnecessary to
countersink the metal.&mdash;Contributed

A Detachable Clamp for Stairway Handrails
</h2>


<p>
The sketch shows a handrail clamp,
or holding device, which is detachable,
for use on stone stairways in the winter
when there is ice or snow on the
steps. The clamps are made of 3/16-in
strap iron, of any desired width, conforming
to the shape of the balustrade
and provided with a hook at either
end. To the inside end of the band an
upright is riveted and to this upright
is riveted an ordinary handrail holder
to take the handrail. A heavy thumb
screw allows the clamp to be fastened
firmly to the balustrade at the outside.
This is a simple and inexpensive device
which affords protection against
falls.&mdash;Contributed by John De La

<h2>
A Homemade Leather Punch
</h2>


<p>
An empty bottle-neck rifle cartridge
can be easily made into a leather punch
by grinding the edge of the opening
sharp and cutting a hole near the top
in one side. The hole is for removing
the leather slugs and should be just a
little larger in diameter than the inside
diameter of the shell. The cartridges
can be had in various sizes and almost
any size of punch can be made.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
A Wood-Scraper Handle
</h2>


<p>
In using a plain scraper on the surface
of wood the task grew exceedingly
tiresome and I lightened the tedious
work to some extent by making a handle
for the scraper. The handle consisted
of a piece of wood, 1&nbsp;in. thick,
3&nbsp;in. wide, and 6&nbsp;in. long. A cut was
made in the edge of the wood the
width of the scraper blade and about
3&nbsp;in. deep, and a bolt run through a
hole bored centrally in the side, about
2-1/2&nbsp;in. from the lower edge. The blade
was clamped in place with the bolt.&mdash;Contributed

<h2>
Polishing Gunstocks
</h2>


<p>
The fine polish applied to gunstocks
and wood parts of tools will not wear
well, and if one cares for a fine finish,
a much better and more durable polish
can be applied as follows: Soak the
wood in linseed oil for a week and then
rub the surface with an oil-soaked cloth
for a short time every day, for a couple of weeks.

<h2>
A Prick-Punch Center Gauge
</h2>


<p>
A simple instrument for finding and
marking the center of shafting, etc.,
can be easily made of three pieces of
sheet brass and a small prick punch.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img453a'>
  <img src='images/img453a.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>The Point of the Punch is Quickly Adjusted to the
Center of the Work</p>
</div>

<p>
Take two pieces of stiff sheet brass,
2-1/2 by 3&nbsp;in. in size, and cut two corners,
1/2&nbsp;in. square, out at one end of
each piece as shown in the sketch.
Bend the metal on the dotted line A,
until it stands at an angle of 45&nbsp;deg.
The part B should be bent up in the
same direction, but at right angles to
the plate, while the part C should be
bent out only slightly. A hole should
be drilled near each corner for rivets.
Be sure that the two plates are bent in
opposite directions, then rivet them
firmly together.
</p>

<p>
Roll one end of a strip of sheet brass,
7/16&nbsp;in. wide and 2-3/4&nbsp;in. long, into a tube
large enough to firmly hold a small
steel prick punch. Place the opposite
end of the brass strip in between the
two ends C. These ends should spring
together slightly in order to hold the
punch D at any height it may be
placed. If accurately made, the point
of the punch will be exactly in the
center of the V-shaped trough.
</p>

<p>
In use, to find and mark the center
of a round bar, it is placed in the
trough with the end just touching the
point of the punch. The brass holding
the punch is raised between the parts C
until the point of the punch is brought
as near to the center of the shaft as can
be judged. Press the point of the
punch against the end of the shaft and
turn the latter in the trough. If the
punch marks a circle the center has not
been found. This is corrected by
slowly moving the punch up or down
until the point ceases to make a circle,
then the punch is tapped with a hammer
to mark the exact center.

<h2>
A Whirligig Clapper
</h2>


<p>
A good noise maker for Halloween
or any other occasion, can be made by
carefully following the directions here
given. The box is the first thing to
make. It is constructed of wood
pieces, 1/2&nbsp;in. thick, and consists of two
ends and two sides. The ends are each
1-1/2&nbsp;in. square and the sides 1-1/2&nbsp;in.
wide and 6&nbsp;in. long. These parts are
nailed together with the ends lapping
the sides.
</p>

<p>
The ratchet wheel A is a disk of
hard wood, 1-1/2&nbsp;in. in diameter. Its
rim is divided into eight equal parts,
and notched with a knife as shown.
It is placed in the forward end of the
box on a wood axle of 3/8-in. diameter
to which it is glued. One end of this
axle is squared and projects 1&nbsp;in. beyond
the side of the box. The squared
end passes through a square hole in
the end of the crank C, which is a
piece of wood 3/4&nbsp;in. thick, 1&nbsp;in. wide
and 4&nbsp;in. long, and is fastened with
brads and glue. At the other end of
the crank, a similar hole connects with
a handle whittled to the shape shown
at B.

A flat piece of steel spring, 1/2&nbsp;in.
wide and long enough to reach from
the rear end of the box to the teeth of
the ratchet wheel, is shaped as shown
at D. The spring may be made from
a stiff piece of corset steel or bicycle
trousers guard. The spring is fastened
with a nail through the end and box
sides and a second nail passes through
the sides over the spring, about 2&nbsp;in.
forward from the first nail. This is to
give the spring tension on the teeth.

Box Partitions

As I needed a box with a number of
narrow partitions and it was impossible
to cut grooves for the sections
without removing the bottom, I spaced
off the places for the partitions with
pieces of thin wood and fastened these
in place with small nails clinched on
the outside of the box. This method
was much more rapid and satisfactory
than sawing the grooves and cutting
them out with a wood chisel.&mdash;Contributed

<p>
A flour bin, counterbalanced to
swing closed at all times, is liable to
catch the arm of the one taking out
flour. To make it safe, I applied the
device shown in the sketch. The bin,
at rest, is shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. The safety
catch consists of a stick of wood, A,
notched at one end, and is pivoted at
B on a small bolt. Two stops, C and
D, are located on the side of the box to
prevent the catch from being thrown
out of position when the bin is quickly
pulled out. These stops are nails
driven into the box side. When the
bin is pulled out the catch takes the
position shown in Fig.&nbsp;2. The catch
stick should be a little shorter than
the distance the bin is pulled out, so
that it may be raised to release the bin
for its return.&mdash;Contributed by O. F.

in width, about 1/2&nbsp;in. from the end.
File off the flange on the shorter shell
so that it will fit snugly against the
side of the other and solder them together.
A ring may be soldered on the
end of the long shell to fasten it on a

<h2>
How to Emboss Stationery
</h2>


<p>
A person's monogram or any special
lettering embossed on stationery is
quite expensive. The engraving of the
dies by experts commanding high salaries,
and the subsequent presswork
necessary to give relief to the design
upon the paper cause an expense
which the economical person hesitates
to accept, much as the refinement and
individuality of the embossed work
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_455' name='Page_455' href='#Page_455'>[455]</a></span>
may be admired. But there is a way
by which almost anyone may emboss
stationery at home with one's own design
at no expense whatever. The
work is easy and the results pleasing,
and monograms or lettering thus done
will compare very favorably with the
printer's work, especially if there is a
good design to follow and the work is
done with care. A little artistic ability
will, of course, aid one in preparing a
design, but is not essential, for the letters
required may be cut from printed
matter and used as a guide for tracing.
There is no limit to the varieties
of work possible by this process. Single
letters, monograms, words or designs
are suitable for reproduction in
raised characters.
</p>

<p>
All the materials required for embossing
the stationery are the envelope
or paper on which the design is
to appear, a stylus and a blotter. The
paper should be of fair quality. If it
is too thin the stylus point is likely to
push through it. The linen-finished
papers of medium weight and tough
texture give excellent results, although
almost any grade of good writing
paper can be used successfully. As
embossing by this process can be done
well only through one thickness of
paper, in working on envelopes it is
best to put the design on the central
portion of the flap, or turn it up and
make the design in the left-hand corner
of the envelope.
</p>

<p>
The stylus may be any kind of a
pencil-like instrument, easy to grip between
the fingers, with a hard, smooth
point, rounded slightly so that it will
not cut the paper. The ordinary bone
stiletto, used in embroidering, makes
an ideal tool for this purpose. If this
is not to be had, a substitute is easily
whittled from a piece of hard wood.
Even a wire nail, with its point
smoothed with a file, may be used, the
upper portion being wound with string
to afford a better grip.
</p>

<p>
The blotter should be white, perfectly
clean, and of good weight. A
thin, hard blotter will not produce a
good raised letter as a softer one will.
When the surface of a blotter has become
covered with creases from repeated
use, it should be discarded and
a new one substituted.
</p>

<div class='img' id='img455'>
  <img src='images/img455.png'
  alt=''
  />
  <p>Manner of Holding the Stylus When Tracing the
Design on the Back Side of the Paper</p>
</div>

<p>
As it is best to adopt a distinctive
form of monogram or design for stationery
and to use it without deviation,
it should be selected or worked up with
care until something is outlined that
will suit. With the design settled upon
and drawn on a piece of paper, go over
it with a soft pencil to deposit sufficient
graphite for an impression. Lay
the pattern, face down, upon the back
of the paper to be embossed, and directly
opposite the spot on the other
side where the raised characters are
to appear. With the handle of a knife
or scissors rub over the back of the
pattern till the graphite has left the
tracing of the design reversed on
the writing paper.
</p>

<p>
The pattern is now laid aside until
required for transferring the design to
another sheet of writing paper. Lay
the blotter on some smooth, hard surface,
such as a desk leaf or table top
and lay the writing paper on the blotter,
reversed design uppermost. Hold
the stylus firmly at an angle as shown
in the illustration and keep the blotter
and paper from moving with the other
hand. Carefully trace the design, using
considerable pressure to insure a good
relief upon the opposite side of the
paper. A soft eraser should be used
to remove the guide marks on the back
of the sheet when the relief is finished.
</p>

<p>
After a little practice with a certain
design, if it is not too intricate, the
operator will find that it can be reproduced
quite faithfully freehand, without
the use of the pattern, but, of
course, the use of the pattern will be
the only guarantee of exact duplicates.

A Homemade Hydrometer
</h2>


<div class='imgfl' id='img456a'>

</div>

<p>
The hydrometer is an instrument
used in determining the specific gravity
of a liquid, such as acids, etc. The specific
gravity of
any material is
the ratio of the
weights of equal
volumes of the
material and
water. Thus if
a pint of acid
weighs 1.2 times
a pint of water,
its specific gravity
is said to be 1.2.
</p>

<p>
A very simple and inexpensive hydrometer,
similar to the one shown in
the sketch, may be easily constructed,
and will give quite satisfactory results,
if the scale on the instrument is carefully
marked when it is calibrated.
</p>

<p>
Purchase from the local druggist or
doctor two test tubes, one large enough
to contain the other, as shown. The
smaller tube is to form the hydrometer
proper, while the larger one is to serve
as a containing vessel in which the
liquid to be tested is placed. The large
tube should be mounted in a vertical
position, by placing it in a hole bored
in a small block of wood, or a suitable
metal or wooden frame may be made
that will accommodate one or more tubes.
</p>

<p>
The small tube is loaded at the lower
end with a quantity of shot, or other
heavy metal, in such a way that it
will stand in a vertical position when
it is placed in a vessel of water. The
amount of the loading will depend
upon whether the hydrometer is to
be used in determining the specific
gravity of liquids heavier or lighter
than water. If the liquids are heavier
than water, the loading should be such
that the tube is almost entirely immersed
when placed in water; if
lighter, only sufficient loading should
be used to make the tube stand upright
in water. After the amount of loading
has been determined it should be fastened
in place by means of a small
quantity of calcined plaster. A small
cork should now be placed in the open
end of the tube, and the tube sealed
by coating the end with shellac, or
melting a small quantity of resin or
sealing wax over the top of the cork
with a hot soldering iron.
</p>

<p>
Now place in the large tube a quantity
of as pure water as can be obtained&mdash;fresh
rain water will answer
very well and distilled water still better.
Immerse the small tube in the water
in the large tube and allow it to come
to rest. Make a small mark on the
small tube with a file, level with the
surface of the water in the large tube.
If the hydrometer is placed in a liquid
lighter than water and allowed to float,
the mark made on the tube will always
be below the surface of the liquid in
which the instrument is placed, and the
mark will be above the surface of the
liquid when the liquid is heavier than water.
</p>

<p>
The hydrometer may be calibrated
by making use of a hydrometer borrowed
from the druggist or doctor.
The two hydrometers should be immersed
in the same liquid and the
tube of the newly made instrument
marked to correspond with the markings
on the borrowed instrument. If
the liquid is heavier than water to start
with, its specific gravity can be reduced
by adding water, and as the water is
added the hydrometers will both rise.

<p>
The supporting arm of the hinged
shelf is constructed of a piece of gas
pipe and a length of iron rod which
slides snugly into the
pipe. A spring catch
is set in the pipe at
the proper height to
engage the end of
the iron rod when
the shelf is up. This
spring must be of
good size, as it holds
the entire weight of the shelf. A large
clock spring is suitable. One end of
the spring is bent outward and upward
to form a releasing handle. The
other end is drilled for the two machine
screws which hold it to the pipe.
The spring works in a rectangular slot,
cut lengthwise of the pipe. The pipe
must extend 8 or 10&nbsp;in. beyond the
spring. The ends of the rod and of
the pipe are pivoted with screws or
rivets on angle pieces screwed to the
shelf and wall.&mdash;Contributed by Donald

How the Capacity of an Incubator may be Doubled
</h2>


<p>
About 10 days after setting the incubator
one may easily start another
hatch by placing more eggs on top of
the incubator in the following manner:
Make a pad about 1&nbsp;in. thick of any cotton
material and place it on top of the
incubator. Cut four pieces of boards,
1 by 4&nbsp;in., and fit them around the top
of the incubator. Nail them together
as in making the sides and ends of a
box. Pad the inside of this frame
about 1&nbsp;in. thick and tack it on top of
the incubator, being careful that none
of the material comes too close to the
lamp. Place the eggs inside of this
tray and cover them with a pad about
3&nbsp;in. thick. Turn the eggs the same
as those on the inside. When the first
hatch comes out, place the eggs kept
on top in the incubator after having
cleaned it with a solution of carbolic
acid.&mdash;Contributed by Hattie J. Day.

<h2>
Typewriting on Card Stock
</h2>


<p>
Anyone having tried to typewrite on
cards or heavy stock has doubtless experienced
much trouble in getting the
card to feed properly. If at all heavy,
it will resist the curving so strongly
that it will not be carried around the
platen, and the edge of the card is very
apt to catch on the pressure rolls and
cause the platen to slip.
</p>

<p>
The remedy is very simple and consists
in running a sheet of paper
through ahead of the card until an
edge of about 1/2&nbsp;in. remains, then inserting
the edge of the card inside of
the projecting edge of the paper and
turning the platen. The paper overlapping
the card prevents the edge of
the latter from catching on the pressure
rolls and keeps it in close contact
with the platen so that it will pass
through without trouble.&mdash;Contributed

The torch shown in the sketch requires
no air pump. Instead of forcing
a small stream of gasoline into a heated
burner it converts
the gasoline
into gas in
the chamber and
blows a small
jet of it through
a very small hole
into the combustion
chamber.
</p>

<p>
A medium-sized
and strong oilcan is used for the
reservoir, the spout being cut off close
to the screw part and a steel or brass
tube, about 5/16&nbsp;in. in diameter, soldered
to the stub end. The tube is
bent as shown. A piece of wicking is
drawn into the tube so that the upper
end is within 1/4&nbsp;in. of the tube end.
The end of the tube is then fitted with
a piece of brass rod with a very small
hole in the center. The hole is made in
the following manner: Before the
piece is cut from the rod, it is held in
a vise and the sharp end of a scriber
is carefully driven into the center. A
little oil placed on the scriber point
will keep it from sticking in the metal.
Measure the depth of the hole and cut
the rod off just above the point. File
the end of the piece cut off with a fine
file until the point of the hole is
reached. This hole must be so small
that light can be barely seen through it.
</p>

<p>
The combustion chamber is made of
a piece of brass tubing driven over the
end of the smaller tube on the spout.
About 1/2&nbsp;in. from the back end of the
larger tube four or more holes are
drilled to admit air to the gas.
</p>

<p>
Fill the can about three-fourths full
of gasoline and allow time for the wick
to become saturated to the upper end.
Hold a lighted match to the rear of
the burner, and the heat will convert
the gasoline into gas which will then
burn with a nice white flame about 1&nbsp;in. long. The success of the torch depends
altogether on the fineness of the
hole in the end of the tube and the
tight soldering of all the joints.

<h2>
A Rule Gauge

<p>
The method of using the thumb as a
gauge on a rule in scribing long boards
is not always satisfactory, especially
if the board has a rough edge. It is
always best to have a regular gauge,
but in the absence of one, an attachment
for an ordinary carpenter's rule
can be quickly made from a piece of
tin, although one made of sheet brass
is better, in appearance as well as for
service. Cut out the metal, as shown
by the dimensions, and roll the two
sides up, stopping at the dotted lines.
The ends A and B are turned out
slightly so that they will slide easily
along the edge of the board. The
gauge will snap on a rule easily and
will stay where it is placed.&mdash;Contributed

Trick Bottles and Glasses<br />

  <p>Under Each Cover Used Is a Bottle and Glass,
and by Pinching the Cover the Bottle is Made to Rise
with It, Thus Leaving the Glass in View</p>
</div>

<p>
The performer presents to his audience
two pasteboard covers, one bottle
and one glass. Saying that he
wishes to secure the safety of the bottle
and glass, he places covers over
them, cautioning the audience to note
carefully which cover incloses the
glass and which the bottle. Then he
says that, to prevent any misunderstanding
as to their positions, it is desired
the audience designate which
cover holds the glass. The response
will be unanimous, "the left" or "the
right" as the case may be, but on raising
that cover the bottle is exposed.
Covering the bottle again, and asking
the audience if they were quite sure
that their eyes did not deceive them,
he states that the glass is really under
the cover just lifted and returned to its
place. To prove it, the cover is lifted
again, to show the glass this time. The
changing can be done as often as desired,
or will amuse the crowd.
</p>

<p>
The secret of the trick consists in
the use of two covers, two bottles and
two glasses, and the manner of performing
it is as follows: The bottles
are bottomless and of such size as to
admit the glass without sticking. A
round hole is cut in one side of each
bottle, about 2-1/2&nbsp;in. above the bottom.
This can be accomplished in a drill
press by using a round copper tube,
with fine emery applied to its end, as
a drill. The hole should be so placed
that a finger will strike the top of the
glass when both bottle and glass are
set on the same surface. If dark-colored
bottles are used, a false bottom can
be made and fitted in each bottle above
the upper edge of the glass. This bottom
can be cemented in place and made
liquid-tight, so that some wine may be
placed in the bottle and poured into
the opposite glass to show that it holds
liquid. In doing this part of the trick,
make no more changes with the wine in
one glass.
</p>

<p>
Under each cover is a bottle and
tumbler, and by pinching the cover,
the bottle is made to rise with it, thus
leaving the tumbler in view. When it
is necessary to show the bottle, just
raise the cover, and the bottle covers
the glass. When the bottle is lifted
from the table, the thumb is inserted
in the hole to press the tumbler
against the opposite side, where it is
held and raised with the bottle. Be
sure to keep the side of the bottles with
the hole back and away from the audience.
</p>

<p>
It will be seen that it matters not
which cover is mentioned; the performer
can show just the article he desires.

It is clearly printed on high-grade book paper and durably bound in
cloth. The cover is of an attractive design in four colors showing a boy

as much as through the purchase of one of
these books.
